unification.80.t:0 "[GetNewspaper]The Church of Toruń unifies Kuyavia-Pomerania!"
unification.80.desc:0 "At noon today, statues were raised in each major Kuyavian city. They all depict the same man – the great warrior of the catholic faith, Lord’s chosen conqueror, the protector of Poland. From humble beginnings in a Redemptorist seminary Father Rydzyk slowly grew a following, founding the most famous religious broadcast in the nation - Radio Maryja. Once criticized for financially exploiting the vulnerable faithful and quietly manipulating the politics of the faltering Polish Republic, he now stands above all his detractors as the undisputed leader of the entire voivodeship. From his evergrowing complex, the aging Rydzyk now drafts plans to spread his message throughout the rest of Poland. For his loyal followers, his further success is all but guaranteed, as clearly the Father Director is blessed in his efforts by God himself.  "

unificationreg.80.t:0 "[GetNewspaper]Rydzyk's forces sack Poznań!"
unificationreg.80.desc:0 "While the Fall disconnected many from the outside world, at times setting Poland to the pre-industrial age, the radio infrastructure stands undisrupted. Today, all stations within Greater Kuyavia transmitted a single message in unison - one that spoke of God’s glory and His triumph over the region’s heathen warlords. Indeed, Father Rydzyk’s forces crushed their regional opposition, vastly increasing the priest’s power, but more importantly – wealth. Following Poznan’s fall, the city was heavily looted, with everything of value hauled back to the cleric’s ever-growing complex, yet even this wouldn't prevent another fund-raising drive from among Toruń’s vulnerable faithful, as Rydzyk seems intent to milk them of all remaining worldly possessions. And though outside his immediate zone of control the priest’s influence remains limited, the state’s rhetoric and service not to the ideals of God, but rather Mammon, has already sown the seed of schism, with the Vatican authorities following further developments with bated breath."

unificationsupreg.80.desc:0 "The vision of a clergy-ruled Poland looms ever closer, as following successful campaigns to both the north and south of his Kuyavian heartlands, Tadeusz Rydzyk stands at the cusp of extending his realm over the entire country. Much to the chagrin of external observers and mainstream Church authorities alike, the priest’s control continues to grow off the backs of his supporters’ contributions, with the army of faithful crusaders, supposedly blessed by the heavens and funded by the cleric’s vast hoards of wealth, growing to rival even those of some EU nations. As Rydzyk’s influence increases, so too do his expressions of decadence, as reports indicate that his Toruń headquarters have since been turned into a den of greed and depravity. Yet with these actions deeply hidden from the public, Western Poland’s false messiah prepares for the final showdown for the soul of the country."

super.80.desc:0 "After a decade of conflict, Poland at last finds itself whole, unified by the same man who once influenced it from the shadows. While Father Rydzyk’s state portrays itself as a theocracy, it would be a misnomer to refer to it as such, as the government operates far more akin to a megacorporation, paying lip service to religious values, while in truth it serves as little more than a money funnel for its founder and patron. With the nation under his thumb, Rydzyk can finally sit back and reap the benefits of his victory, enjoying all of life’s carnal pleasures, surrounded by splendor fit only for someone of his grand stature. Yet as he grows increasingly more infirm with age, it appears that the priest’s time on earth is rapidly drawing to a close. Soon, he shall be judged in front of his creator, and no amount of wealth, nor the carefully maintained illusion of faith, will be enough to save him then."

unification.149.t:0 "[GetNewspaper]The Principality of Kuyavia unifies Kuyavia-Pomerania!"
unification.149.desc:0 "The fall of Rydzyk opened Pandora’s Box in Toruń as factions turned on each other, seeing their one chance at power. Surprisingly, the dark horse of the city’s politics has emerged victorious, with Jacek Hoga of the reactionaries now in charge. An enigma even among local residents, reports seem to suggest that the new leader aims to turn the nation into a form of monarchy. After purging the city of all remaining influence of Rydzyk, the state turned outwards, using their militias and paramilitaries to crush all other forces within the voivodeship. Relative stability returns to the region as the fledgling nation searches for its identity. Refugees flooding from the region speak of an aggressive campaign to promote traditional values to bring the rest of the region up to speed with the faction’s politics as numerous rights previously enjoyed by the people of Kuyavia are quickly being curtailed."

unification.150.t:0 "[GetNewspaper]Kujawja Academic Corporation unifies Kuyavia-Pomerania!"
unification.150.desc:0 "The guard has changed in Toruń, as the church rules no more. Following shocking and disgusting revelations of Rydzyk’s debauchery, his support dwindled and a formerly-allied faction overthrew him. Sławomir Mentzen, leader of one of the four main branches of the Confederation and official successor to the controversial Janusz Korwin-Mikke refused to rest on his laurels and took the already significant forces of Toruń on a grand campaign, culminating in the total conquest of the voivodeship. A staunch believer in free-market policies, Mentzen aims to foster a new culture of business and entrepreneurship in Kuyavia. While his critics point to increasing exploitation of the populace by the empowered companies, the leader tosses those worries aside in pursuit of economic growth. With the war-torn region already suffering from high rates of poverty, it remains to be seen whether Mentzen’s plan will be just what’s needed to put it back on its’ feet."

unification.151.desc:0 "The revealing of Rydzyk’s transgressions against the laws of both God and Man was a grave shock for the people of Toruń. Almost immediately, schemes began to form, aiming to depose him once and for all. Disaffected and disgusted by the Father Director’s true character, paramilitaries of the 1909 Shooters' Brigade under Adam Ślusarski were the first to act, as a bloody coup and repressions against Rydzyk’s clique followed. Since then, Toruń has been transformed into a true military machine, churning out guns and equipment for the army. Thanks to those preparations, the warlord quickly gained the upper hand in the wars of regional unification, as city after city fell under their onslaught. Mandatory conscription has been issued for all eligible citizens as the army fills its ranks in preparation for another conquest."
