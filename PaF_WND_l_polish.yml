unification.145.t:0 "[GetNewspaper]People's Banner "Wanda" unifies Lesser Poland!"
unification.145.desc:0 "After months of fierce urban warfare and brotherly conflict, Kraków is at last free, and with it, all of Lesser Poland. Though they were at first perceived as relative outsiders with little chance to expand beyond their isolated positions on the Free City’s outskirts, in their fight for human dignity, the partisans of the “Wanda” People’s Banner displayed discipline and courage unmatched by their more established foes, eventually securing the region’s complete liberation. Having led the people to this victory, it now falls upon Małgorzata Wassermann to transform the directionless organization into a proper government. And while her promises of reform and the safeguarding of unalienable rights can rouse the masses to action, her ties to the former PiS regime bind her, risking the alienation of the Banner’s more radical members. Without direction, however, the revolution of dignity would simply wither in its cradle."
unification.145.a:0 "Any fool can lead their people to war. A true leader unites them in peacetime."
