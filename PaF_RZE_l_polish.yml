rzeszow_siege.2.t:0 "[GetNewspaper]The Siege of Rzeszów"
rzeszow_siege.2.desc:0 "For the past month we've been hearing tales about Braun's guerilla campaign against the Ukrainian humanitarians and the following breakup of the Ukrainian Humanitarian Mission. However, judging by recently appearing hearsay, shit has hit the fan for Braun and now his small duchy has found itself sieged down by the newly-revived UPA and a Polish-Ukrainian 'Cossack' host. \n\nRefugees and couriers from Rzeszów speak of the city's populations' simultaneous high organization and second hand-embarassment from Braun's actions, and all-time high morale amongst Braun's loyalists, who now claim that they've been 'right all along'. Both Ukrainian armies seem hellbent on exacting revenge on Braunists, and it's unclear whether the civilians will come unscaved from this conflict if some more radical party wins the race to capture the city first. May God be with the commonfolk of Subcarpathia, for *they* are the real losers of this conflict."

RZE_patodeveloperka:0 "Patodeweloperka"
RZE_patodeveloperka_desc:0 "Patodeweloperka (patho-development) is a Polish word created to describe the free reign of real estate developers and lack of city planning. While it is a problem in most cities, Rzeszów is one of the most affected, especially with the No Government Intervention policy implemented by Braun."
RZE_ukrainian_siege:0 "Ukrainian Siege"
RZE_ukrainian_siege_desc:0 "After the Ukrainians pulled off the impossible and drove back the Russian invasion, Braun - a staunch Russophile with ties to Moscow - openly denounced Zelensky's government, seeing him as a wrench in the cogs of the Russkiy Mir. As such, when the Ukrainians entered the Subcarpathian Voivodeship to establish the Ukrainian Humanitarian Mission, he started a guerilla war against them, seeking to drive them back to their side of the border. \n\nAnd so - he fucked around and found out, and now Rzeszów is completely cut off from the outside world from the east by disgruntled Ukrainian ex-soldiers-turned-UPA LARPers who want to take revenge for how the Poles welcomed their help offer, and from the other side by a joint coalition of humanitarians and local natives who now brand themselves as a Cossack host. Unless he'll find a way to break the Ukrainian blockade, Braun's holy duchy will become what he fought - a burning pile of rubble, driven over by T-80s and BMPs."
