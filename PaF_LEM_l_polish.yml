POLITICS_PAISIOS_DESC:0 "Paisios I Martyniuk (born 7 July 1969) is a Polish Orthodox archbishop of the Archdiocese of Przemyśl and Gorlice. He took monastic vows on 6 April 1989 in the St. Onuphrius Monastery in Jabłeczna. He served as a bishop of Piotrków from 2007 and of Gorlice from 2009. He represented the Polish Orthodox Church on numerous conferences and delegations around the world. He became an archbishop on 9 October 2017. After the Collapse, the Orthodox Lemko administration invited archbishop Martyniuk, who at the time was in Gorlice, to lead the fledgling state, much to the dismay of the Greek and Roman Catholic populace in the region. Though taken by surprise, as he is not a Lemko himself, Paisios agreed, seeing the decision as a sign from God. He faces strong opposition from the non-Orthodox Lemkos and Poles, who view him as a despotic theocrat. Archbishop Martyniuk, however, is not as ruthless as his opposition seems to believe. He wishes for nothing but peace for all of his subjects, only aiming to solve the issues at hand before a more permanent leader can be found. The deep divide within the Lemko society may however prove too challenging for His Eminence. Nothing short of a miracle could bring lasting unity to the young state."

unification.43.desc:0 "All across the Polish Tatras, church bells ring in unison to celebrate the unification of the nation’s southernmost region by the newly ascendant Holy Lemko State, an event officially marked by a ceremonial handshake between local militiamen and Czech border guards – the first sign of international recognition for the Lemkovyna. Although the country’s government is dominated by Orthodox clergy, observers describe it as a mixed theocratic republic that incorporates Roman and Greek Catholic, as well as secular administrative bodies into its structure. Despite prevailing over the region’s other statelets, the republic’s longevity has been called into question due to rising internal strife between the territory’s multiple religious and cultural groups. But even if it manages to reform and consolidate into a fully functional state, little hope remains for the Lemkovyna’s survival, as rival governments from up north aim to reconquer the territories they deem as rightfully belonging to Poland."
