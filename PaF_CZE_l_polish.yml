 POLITICS_TOMIO_DESC:0 "The fallen leaves tell a story, and when the last of them from the Great Prague Elm fell on Okamura Tomio's face, he finally stood up. The situation after the Fall of Poland also hit the Czech Republic. After they were forcibly transformed into an EU protectorate, not all of them remained passive. Tomio Okamura, the spirit of Czech pragmatism and Japanese steadfastness, began to gather around him those who wanted to fight. However, the occupation forces quickly outlawed his political party and threatened to arrest the rebellious politician. Okamura's wisdom overtook the enemy's movement and he managed to escape from the Czech capital before the planned manhunt. The fallen Poland, broken into small, anarchic pieces, turned out to be a refuge, where the new czecho-japanese daimyo can start the fight against oppression from the West."
 POLITICS_RUMCAJS_DESC:0 "Going through Sudety Mountains was very difficult for Tomio Okamura's army. All the chaos, fighting Poles and Eurokommissariat forces, roaming bandits looking for easy loot and of course cold nights, strong wind, and dump clothes. It could end in high attrition and number of casualties, if not him. He's called Rumcajs, but nobody knows who he really is. His scary menpo and kabuto always stay on him whenever somebody is around. Meeting with Daimyo was also as mysterious as that. Tired army met him right at the border, where he greeted them with strange-sounding Japanese. Together with his squad of also masked men, he offered his guidance during the hard route through the mountains. The Daimyo accepted his service, not really sure for his intentions. Well... Brave men like him are too precious to ask too many questions."
 POLITICS_KOMOROWSKI_DESC:0 "The second (after Bronisław Piłsudski) Japanese culture lover and propagator form Poland. He was the first president of the Republic of Poland to grant the Shogun nomination to a Polish general. However, after losing the elections, he removed himself from high-profile politics only periodically criticizing the ruling coalition. The fall changed everything. The former president decided to leave the restless capital ruled by the remnants of hostile power. When he heard about the Japanese-Czech commander creating his state in the south, he decided to take advantage of the long-gone chance. As a specialist in diplomacy with the Far East and, of course, a former president, he offered his services to the daimyo of Kłodzko, who accepted."

okamura.1.t:0 "An Unexpected Sunrise"
okamura.1.desc:0 "It was early dawn. In the twilight of the sleeping town of Kłodzko a great red-brick fortress loomed, reminding the Eurocommission's small garrison of its former might. One who was on a night watch, which was about to end soon, was already dozing off while standing. He was facing the north-east side thinking about those shattered wild post-polish lands and what horrible things may be going on there.\n\n Wind was gently blowing from behind. Then came slight scent of smoke, minute after minute getting stronger. Looking for the source of the smell, he walked to the other side of the fort. When he peeked out beyond the north wall and looked to the south his body froze. He saw a great fire in the distance. The pillar of flames was illuminating the still dark sky. Bystrzyca Kłodzka was all in flames. When the soldier came closer to the lower walls of the fortress, he noticed silhouettes running in the streets. "Something is terribly wrong in here." - he thought and ran to sound the alarm.\n\n Breathless he reached the switch, but then he noticed, the cable was cut. "Alarm! We are under attack!" - he screamed at the top of his lungs, but suddenly he fell silent like a Krakow bugle caller. The soldier looked down - a small blade pierced his chest. He couldn't make a sound. His muscles stopped responding. He couldn't even turn around to see his opponent, he just fell to the ground lifeless. The shinobi wiped his sword from the unaware guardian’s blood and climbed the wall overlooking the town street. Then he lit a flare, signaling to the hidden waiting soldiers of the new Daimyo to attack the still sleeping town."

unification.47.desc:0 "Messengers report disturbing news from Lower Silesia. The voivodeship was united under the iron hand of the shogun from Kłodzko fortress. His fearless samurai wearing clan sashimono and numerous, well-equipped ashigaru made their way to unify the region with steel and fire.\n\n The newly proclaimed shogun, daimyo Tomio Okamura, did not have a strong position as the ruler of the Kłodzko region. Leading a risky attack on EK garrison, then fighting rogue ronins, treacherous general Rumcajs, and facing the strong opposing voices of the former president of Poland, the leader of the radical wing of the shogunate, and the master, the authority of the samurai - and still succeeded. Now the authorities of the mighty shogun of Vratisowafu, hastily reshape the previous power structures, to tackle the Czecho-Nipponisation of the Lower Silesian population."
