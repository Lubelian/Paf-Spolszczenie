TNO.1.desc:0 "The door swung open with a bang. KMT squaked. His skirt moved slightly due to the gust of wind. Schab, with determination painted on his face, ran into the room and picked him up into his arms. The copy of W. Reymont's 'The Peasants' slipped from the Bumfuckian femboy's hand.\n\nWhat's happening? What are you doing? - he asked Schab in a trembling voice\n\nSchab didn't reply. Instead, he moved his lips closer to KMT's lips. At first, the femboy tried to resist, but he gave up after a couple of seconds. Relaxed, he embraced Schab's head with his hand, prolonging the kiss. A good minute has passed before they’ve finished.\n\nBut why? - KMT asked in a whisper - Why right now? \nI have nothing to lose - Schab responded, looking back where he came from.\n\nA gigantic figure in a stahlhelm was staring at them with its inhuman, rotting face.\n\nWHERE THE FUCK IS THE FINISHED MAP OF PODLASIE? - the figure roared with such power and fury, that the ground quaked violently.\n\nKMT and Schab looked at each other. They knew what was about to happen to them. So, they kissed again.\n\nAnd they kept on kissing each other until the end.\n\nFin."
