 ##Characters##
POLITICS_ADAM_MALYSZ_DESC:0 "Adam Małysz was a national hero. And then the nation as a united monolith ceased to exist, divided by a wall. He returned to his hometown, Wisła, wishing to survive the coming storm in peace. That... was not meant to be, as an opportunity to save his own neighbourhood from the fire consuming the whole country quickly made him give up his retirement. \n\nMałysz joined the newly formed Council of the Provisional Government of the Podbeskidzie Republic as one of the advisors and social representatives. He had hoped that even if only to a small extent, he could contribute to the survival of democracy in Poland. The peace, however, did not last forever as the president of the Republic of Podbeskidzie, Jerzy Buzek, fell ill and died in office. \n\nWith the president's death and raids from local upstarts becoming more and more rampant, the Council fell into chaos, unable to solidify their statelet's position. Days spent on bickering and panicking became weeks, and the republic's already bad situation became even worse. After two months and a couple hundreds dead civilians, Golec brothers - together with the local law enforcement forces - forcibly entered the town hall in Bielsko-Biała, arrested the Council's members, declared themselves interim rulers and quickly plunged the country into infighting with those unwilling to serve and live under an even temporary junta if it is willing to sacrifice everything in the name of stability, down to utilizing methods as bloody as those of the bandits plaguing the mountains. \n\nMałysz was one of the few who were let go, all thanks to the public's opinion of him. Following the coup, he rushed eastward - first to Wisła, and then to Cieszyn, organizing a resistance movement and forming an counter-coup force to retake Bielsko-Biała. \n\nThe Golec brothers, learning about this betrayal, broke at least one trombone and two trumpets. \n\nNow the drums of war are growing louder and louder at the borders of Cieszyn County. Will mere willpower be enough for the last proponent of freedom in the region to emerge victorious? Or will the young Republic of Podbeskidzie become as vile as the forces it tried to fight back in the first place?"

unification.38.desc:0 "Even after all that’s happened, eagles soar into the sky. In a place dominated by the mad, the power-hungry and the cruel, Adam Małysz, who gained national acclaim during his extremely successful ski jumping career, gathered a following that ended up ruling Silesian voivodeship from Cieszyn. On the remnants of the westernmost EU vassals, he leads a moderate democratic republic, poised to restore the country to European democracy. \nYet, from the depths of the new statelet, rumors surface of greater ambitions still. In place of the ski-jumping boards where Małysz once won his medals (gold ones included), rumors of mysterious launching pads surface. Some comment that Małysz is laying the groundwork for his very own space program, hopeful he, a former sportsman, can bring the nation from the brink and into the stars, even though their expertise on the subject is, quote - “over 400 hours in Kerbal Space Program”."

super.24.desc:0 "Adam Małysz became national hero twice. And not even for a second he was a villain. In the eyes of the people he is as revered as the Pope. At first, he was just humble ski jumper, racer and manager.\n\nBut it's a long way from Cieszyn, and Adam rose from murderous fight with Bandit Brothers to saving country from its worst enemy - itself. When he conquered Silesia, everyone saw how illustrious his rule is. Though he did not want it, he was meant to be Poland's salvation. Many just surrendered and switched sides, and those who did not, eventually perished by the sheer will of Małysz' followers.'\n\nNow the Eagle from Wisła looks into the sky, as that's where the true future lies. Not only for Poland, but for the entire human race. And he is only that much. A Hero of Humanity."
