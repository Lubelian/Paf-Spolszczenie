unification.52.desc:0 "Recent news from Greater Poland indicate that the northern half of the voivodeship, still reeling from the collapse of the Eurokommissariats, has been overtaken by forces loyal to the All-Polish Initiative, an organization with deep ties to the pre-Fall National Movement. Seizing upon the momentum of their armed uprising against Tusk and his German masters, the group managed to seize the regional centers of Poznań and Piła, solidifying their iron grip on the territory. Described by critics as prone to fascistic leanings, the new government instituted a massive militarization of daily life with fiercely jingoistic rhetoric towards the state’s enemies, while internal politics have largely been defined by strict enforcement of deeply traditionist values, with any display of progressive, non-Christian and LGBT sympathies harshly penalized. It seems that in a single flash, all of the defeated Eurokommissar’s efforts to bring European values to the region have been undone, as Greater Poland spirals further into the abyss of nationalism.
