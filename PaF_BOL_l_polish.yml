unification.85.desc:0 "Now tell me where you’ve heard this one before: Solidarność in Gdańsk? Ring any bells? Well it should, even more so in recent days as a great dose of Deja Vu comes rushing to us over radio waves and oh so expensive printer ink. Lech Wałęsa along with Solidarność have managed to restore order to the region of Pomerelia in the past weeks. Many may recall the collapse of the Eurokomissariats; the chaos and fears of the region falling into complete anarchy and banditry. Though that may have been true to some extent, it also set the stage for many others to take the stage in Pomerelia, Lech Wałęsa being chief among them. Wałęsa became a beacon of hope in the remains of the German Intervention’s territories, experiencing an unexpected surge in popularity which helped rally people to his cause. So we’ll watch on then, as yet another familiar face appears on the board of Post-Fall Poland."
