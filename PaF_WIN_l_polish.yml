unification.70.desc:0 "Lubusz Voivodeship was a place rarely thought of by the wider Polish public before the Fall. Today's news, however, will remain in the air for quite some time - especially amongst the members of the Ministry of Agriculture and those who enjoy the *finer* things in life. \n\nToday, the Hedonistic Republic of Winnygród - as the joint clique of Zielona Góra's city council and Lubuskie's winemakers have took to calling themselves - have declared the complete conquest of the past voivodeship. Everywhere across their newly aquired lands, wannabe alcohol manufacturers, pimps and owners of other... *controversial* enterprises rejoice as their businesses can feel right at home in the semi-anarchic republic. Several high-ranked cultural and wine-related institutions across Europe have expressed words of gratitude to the City Council, commenting their efforts in preserving Polish winemaking."
