unification.70.t:0 "[GetNewspaper]Winnygród jendoczy Lubuskie!"
unification.70.desc:0 "Lubusz Voivodeship has historically been a place rather forgotten by the wider Polish public. Today's news, however, will remain in the air for quite some time - especially amongst the members of the Ministry of Agriculture and those who enjoy the finer things in life. \n\nThe Hedonistic Republic of Winnygród - as the joint clique of Zielona Góra's city council and Lubuskie's winemakers has taken to calling itself - has declared the complete conquest of the former voivodeship. All across their newly acquired lands wannabe alcohol manufacturers, pimps, and owners of other... *controversial* enterprises rejoice as their businesses can feel right at home in the semi-anarchic republic. Several high-ranking cultural institutions and prominent sommeliers across Europe have expressed words of gratitude towards this new state, commending its efforts in preserving Polish winemaking."

unificationreg.70.desc:0 "Young in age and spirit, the Hedonistic Republic of Winnygród - or rather of Silesia - shows no signs of stopping its drug- and wine-induced stampede along the Oder as the last Lower Silesian resistance holdouts of post-Eurokommissariat governments surrender or escape to Czechia, leaving Winnygród as the sole power controling land in the voivodeship. \n\nWhile most of the region's population will have to get accustomed to public displays of anarchy and hedonism the republic prides itself on, those more accustomed to a life of drinking and singing - the Romas of Legnica and Jawor and the alcoholics of Wałbrzych Basin (even known to some as the Hobo Basin) - are reportedly already celebrating the republic's victory out in the streets, joining Winnygród's soldiers in banquets and sending badly written letters to Lubuskie's winemakers, thanking for their intervention and wishing them the best in spreading the craft of winemaking to Lower Silesia."

unificationsupreg.70.desc:0 "Although much more sober and organised, the armies of Upper Silesia failed to stop the jolly volunteers of the Hedonistic Republic of Silesia in their tracks, with the republic's largely nonexistent government banding together today to publicly declare the complete unification of the historic Silesia region. \n\n\nAs the soldiers of the Hedonistic Republic of Silesia OD in roadside ditches and crash their tanks into random buildings, Southwestern Poles pop corks of smuggled and counterfeit champagne bottles and gather together to celebrate the Republic's libertine culture and laws, getting high off their newfound freedoms. \n\nAnd various narcotics."

super.70.t:0 "[GetNewspaper]Poland - United in Ecstasy"
super.70.desc:0 "Today's events have left governments across the world dumbfolded, unable to decide whether the state that now spans all of Polish territories should be treated as a real, internationally recognized country, or as yet another bunch of weirdo anarchist upstarts who will quickly fall to other warlording groups. International media and the Poles themselves, however, unanimously state one thing: \n\nThe Polish Civil War has finally come to an end, as indicated by millions of people who have gathered on Polish streets, united in celebration, dance and drinking whilst covered in vines and robes in what the Council of the Hedonistic Republic of Poland - as the new, largely informal and nonexistent ''government'' of the country is called - describes as the first day of ''Eternal Bacchanalia'' which from now on shall engulf Poland in ecstasy and positive emotions, uniting the nation forever."
