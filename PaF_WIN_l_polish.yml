unification.70.desc:0 "Lubusz Voivodeship was a place rarely thought of by the wider Polish public before the Fall. Today's news, however, will remain in the air for quite some time - especially amongst the members of the Ministry of Agriculture and those who enjoy the *finer* things in life. \n\nToday, the Hedonistic Republic of Winnygród - as the joint clique of Zielona Góra's city council and Lubuskie's winemakers have took to calling themselves - have declared the complete conquest of the past voivodeship. Everywhere across their newly aquired lands, wannabe alcohol manufacturers, pimps and owners of other... *controversial* enterprises rejoice as their businesses can feel right at home in the semi-anarchic republic. Several high-ranked cultural and wine-related institutions across Europe have expressed words of gratitude to the City Council, commenting their efforts in preserving Polish winemaking."

unificationsupreg.70.desc:0 "Although much more sober and organised, the armies of Upper Silesia failed to stop the jolly volunteers of the Hedonistic Republic of Silesia in their tracks, with the republic's largely nonexistent government banding together today to publicly declare the complete unification of the historic Silesia region. \n\n\nAs the soldiers of the Hedonistic Republic of Silesia OD in roadside ditches and crash their tanks into random buildings, Southwestern Poles pop corks of smuggled and counterfeit champagne bottles and gather together to celebrate the Republic's libertine culture and laws, getting high off their newfound freedoms. \n\nAnd various shady narcotics."
