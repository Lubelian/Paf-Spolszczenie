unification.72.t:0 "[GetNewspaper]Motorcracy of Gorzów unifies Lubuskie"
unification.72.desc:0 "In a shocking twist of fate, the Lubuskie voivodeship has been unified not by the remnants of Polish or German military formations, but rather by a Clique whose existence could only be possible within the nation’s unique environment. Oriented around a core group of speedway fanatics of Gorzów Wielkopolski’s historic Stal, the Motorcracy of Gorzów serves as a state for all those who love the excitement and thrill of the road, with vehicles venerated and races serving as both the greatest entertainment and means of attaining status within the government. Though it was predicted to quickly fall to its more organized enemies, the state managed to achieve victory through an extreme reliance on maneuver warfare, effortlessly cutting off and encircling opposing forces until their eventual submission. As tanks made their triumphal lap across the team’s stadium, tens of thousands joined the celebrations of their unlikely victory. Though the state remains surrounded by hostile governments, who knows just how far their motorbikes can them?"
