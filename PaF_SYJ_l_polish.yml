unification.51.t:0 "[GetNewspaper]New Zion unifies Northern Greater Poland!"
unification.51.desc:0 "Truly bizarre news emerge from Wielkopolska, perhaps the greatest proof that Poland has lost its sanity. A fringe religious movement, at least nominally following the Christian faith; outside observers have described the so-called “New Zion” as a dangerous cult and a disaster just waiting to happen. Adherent to a near-incomprehensible mess of beliefs, often directly contradictory to official dogma, the state is held together by one thing only – the presence of their supposed prophet - Jarosław Lichwała. Each day new theories spew from his mouth, denouncing the fundamental laws of the known world. Amassing a fanatical following heeding his every word, it took only a single word for them to throw themselves into combat. They fought like a horde, a force unbothered by morale. Unable to push back the unstoppable mass of bodies, warlords fell one by one, with the prophet eventually in full control of the region. Only an outside force can save Wielkopolska now."
unification.51.a:0 "A new messiah, just as crazy as this land"
