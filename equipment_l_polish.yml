Not very sophisticated, nor very useful against someone with a gun."
 melee_equipment_1: "Standardized Old Melee Weapons"
 melee_equipment_1_desc:0 "Found machetes, axes, tools and hunting knives that could be used in an army, renovated and standardized across our ranks, so that our sappers no longer have to dig with sticks and soup spoons."

 melee_weapons_upgrade:0 "Serrations"
 melee_weapons_upgrade_desc:"In post-Fall Poland, brute strength is the be-all, end-all argument. No one cares about the rules of war - everyone is an acceptable casualty. Especially since people die left and right even outside of battle, due to the lack of medical goods and infrastructure. The only way to avoid death here is to play dirty, and speaking of "dirty": all these rusty knives and tools lying around could come in handy, especially with some new teeth carved onto their blades."
 melee_weapons_upgrade_1:0 "Proper Refurbishment & Maintenance"
 melee_weapons_upgrade_1_desc:0 "Our soldats have received weapons matching their role. They've been properly refurbished - they're theirs now, so they need to last for long and be in good condition. By giving our troops a basic rundown of how to maintain them and providing army-wide access to equipment such as grit paper, sharpening stones and heavy-duty tape we can ensure that their weapons won't snap in half or turn out to be completely blunt while they try to batter someone down with them."
 melee_weapons_upgrade_2:0 "Hand-to-Hand Combat Training"
 melee_weapons_upgrade_2_desc:0 "Stabbing without getting stabbed back. Pacifying enemy combatants with a single baton hit to the head. Taking accurate axe swings at enemies. Studying the blade. \n\nBy training our close quarter divisions the art of hand-to-hand combat we ensure that when two bunches of brutes meet on the battlefield, the bunch of brutes that belongs to us will come out on top."
 melee_weapons_upgrade_3:0 "Safe Engagement Tactics"
 melee_weapons_upgrade_3_desc:0 "As all rabble armies and bandit groups evolved into proper armies, guns became a mainstay on Polish battlefields. If we are to continue using troops dedicated for point-blank range combat, we have to engineer tactics that will allow our men to close the distance between them and enemies without taking 20 bullets to the face first."
 melee_weapons_upgrade_4:0 "CQC Mastery"
 melee_weapons_upgrade_4_desc:0 "We have mastered urban close quarters combat thanks to a confluence of innovative infiltration of enemy positions and skillful positioning and movement. Cunning and deadly effective, our melee-oriented stormtroopers are able to uphold and penetrate any city defense lines with ease."

 ranged_equipment_3:0 "Cold War-Era Firearms"
 ranged_equipment_3_desc:0 "Good ol' AKs and AK derivatives, along with other weapons commonly sold on the black market. While quite unwieldy in comparison to modern firearms, they more than make up for their weight and recoil with how easy they are to clean and maintain."

#ranged upgrady
 ranged_weapons_upgrade:0 "Weapons Of Ye Olden Days"
 ranged_weapons_upgrade_desc:0 "We lack guns, and we have to resort to using the simplest, most primitive ways to kill people from afar - that's why we should adopt the weaponry of our ancestors: bows, crossbows, slings and javelins - weapons that are easy to manufacture without industrial tools, yet can still kill and provide leverage over people armed with just shovels and bayonets."
 ranged_weapons_upgrade1:0 "Homemade Riot Shotguns"
 ranged_weapons_upgrade1_desc:0 "Traumatic weapons lack the range and stopping power of conventional firearms, reducing their usefulness outside of close quarter encounters. While we can't do too much about their effective range, we can, for example, adapt them to be used specifically at short-to-mid ranges and simply add more pellets per shot to increase their stopping power. Because as we all know - if a problem can't be solved by using a gun, then the best way to deal with it is to use MORE gun. \n\nMore shot, actually."
 ranged_weapons_upgrade2:0 "Safety Standards"
 ranged_weapons_upgrade2_desc:0 "It's understandably hard to make functioning guns with nothing but springs and pipes in barns and basements, but we should still include some standards of safety for our weapons so that they don't explode in our hands just because a small breadcrumb made its way into the chamber."
 ranged_weapons_upgrade3:0 "Cold War-Era Vision Equipment"
 ranged_weapons_upgrade3_desc:0 "We may have the weapons to conduct larger scale warfare, but we still lack the technology for it. Small-scale adoption of old, Soviet-era scopes, night vision and thermal vision equipment, as well as other devices used for tracking movement and viewing enemy positions could help us out in that department. Just don't use this stuff to spy on them while they're showering, please."
 ranged_weapons_upgrade4:0 "Special Ammo Types"
 ranged_weapons_upgrade4_desc:0 "One of the benefits of weapons from later NATO days is the standarization of calibers across weapon of the same type. Thanks to the fact that the same bullets match most guns in one unit, we can much more comfortably implement special ammo types into our army, as we no longer have to buy 20 different calibers serving the exact same purpose."

 infantry_training1:0 "Basic Infantry Training"
 infantry_training1_desc:0 "Teaching how to provide first aid to fallen teammates and going through most basic battle tactics will sharply increase survivability of our troops and is the first step towards shaping them into a real army, instead of the more or less organized mob they currently are."
 infantry_training2:0 "Advanced Infantry Training"
 infantry_training2_desc:0 "An extremely effective and important way of training our soldiers' reflexes, aim and independent thinking in the heat of action is to set them off against each other in very intensive and painful paintball matches.

 infantry_training5_desc:0 "Ex-NATO-inspired methods of training armies, with improvements based on our own experiences in the Polish Civil War. With top-tier training like this and so much army experience, our enemies can count on us that we will be ready. We will be effective. We will be deadly. If a joint European-Russian invasion was to be launched, if the walls were to come crashing down - we'll make it through. We will fight back. And FINALLY...   perhaps FINALLY our soldiers will learn that '4' in Roman numerals is written as 'IV', not 'IIII'."

 camouflage_upgrade1:0 "Matching Sizes"
 camouflage_upgrade1_desc:0 "It's hard to run and shoot in uniforms and boots that are two sizes too small. We're better off sacrificing some extra time to find clothes that actually fit their wearer before handing them over to our soldiers. At least they'll no longer have the excuse that they can't march because their shoes are too tiny for their feet."
 equipment_vests_2:0 "Uniforms w/ Standard Camouflage Patterns"
 equipment_vests_2_desc:0 "Most of the camo patterns we've been using so far were based off of civilian, mil themed products that aren't actually viable for camouflage. Instead, we should re-adapt old camouflage patterns that we're actually designed for combat and tested in practice."
 camouflage_upgrade2:0 "Better Materials & Sewing Methods"
 camouflage_upgrade2_desc:0 "As our army evolves, its equipment has to evolve as well. We now possess enough resources to replace the uniforms our army was using so far with ones made from newer, much more comfortable, durable and fireproof materials and sewing methods - because a comfy soldier is a loyal soldier."
 equipment_vests_3:0 "Uniforms w/ Modern Camo Patterns"
 equipment_vests_3_desc:0 "We shouldn't still cling to old, pre-Fall camo designs that probably still remember the Soviet Union when we have the means to design better, more advanced ones - like the ones used by modern armies."

 special_forces_quantity1_desc:0 "It's hard to provide supplies to units whose job is to take the hardest fights onto themselves or to hide in mountains and forests.

By capitalizing on regional sentimentalisms amongst our montane, forest and seaside populations we can form a new identity of speciality and servitude to the state, upon which we can build myths, legends and hearsay that will bring in hundreds of new recruits wishing to live up to their local heroes' names."
