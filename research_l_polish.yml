 escort_buffs:"Escort Focus"
 escort_buffs_desc:"Our fleet is too vulnerable and an attack on the enemy could mean the end of our presence in the waters. Everything we have should focus on protecting our transport, trade and other civilian units."
 escort_buffs_2:"Detection And Escape"
 escort_buffs_2_desc:"Our captains shouldn't be playing tough, especially when they're escorting defenseless units. Careful observation and retreat when the enemy is certainly pushing forward will save a lot of valuable people and equipment."

 tbs_as_escorts:"Warships As Escorts"
 tbs_as_escorts_desc:"Focusing the core of our fleet on defending weak boats is essential. Engaging in unnecessary combat will not bring much at this point and the risk of lossing some unit is too great."
 tbs_as_escorts_2:"Hard Side To Enemy"
 tbs_as_escorts_2_desc:"It's not about how hard you hit. It's about how hard you can get hit and keep moving forward. How much you can take and keep moving forward. That's how winning is done!"
 tbs_as_escorts_3:"Signal From Every Way"
 tbs_as_escorts_3_desc:"Knowing, seeing or hearing which side to expect the attack from, gives the defenders a great advantage at the start. Let the radio operators remain vigilant at all times is a great task."

 post_collapse_assesment_desc:"The Polish state has succumbed into chaos and disintegrated. Laws are enforced ad-hoc, most industries have died or stopped working and most people have to ration food, water and other resources due to the downfall of most supply chains and shops (besides Żabka. Żabka could survive a fucking nuclear disaster and still somehow capitalize on it), resulting in what is basically a light post-apo scenario. \n\nWe have to assess the damage done during the Fall to start rebuilding a new state out of the ruins of old Poland."
 improvised_computing:"Civilian-Grade Government Computing"
 improvised_computing_desc:"We currently have to rely on mobile phones, handwritten documents and a few spare printers and laptops that belonged to people forming our new government, most of them still running Windows Vista.

At least in moments when the neighbouring warlords aren't burdening the power grid."
 early_civilian_computing:"Reestablishment Of Businesses & Civilian Computing"
 early_civilian_computing_desc:"As the chaos in the country died down, the emerging political movements became entrenched and people got used to living in a war-torn country, the population slowly started rebuilding itself, reestablishing their businesses and/or workplaces and using computers on a daily basis again, which sets us on a course to veeeeeeeeeeery slowly revert the brain drain that our country suffered from during the Fall."
 civilian_computing:"Reestablished Education System & Basic Military Development Sectors"
 civilian_computing_desc:"As our statelet grows in power and possesses more resources, we can finally start rebuilding the education sector of the government, reestablishing smaller, rural education facilities, providing them with resources and providing people with easier access to them. \nWe can also establish a proper - if very basic - military development sector in the army and the government, so that our army no longer has to test and adapt new equipment by testing it in a far-away field, hoping that it doesn't explode and instantly kill them during usage."
 imported_mainframes:"Reestablished Intelligentsia"
 imported_mainframes_desc:"As the country rebuilds itself, and more and more elements of pre-Fall life return back, our political and academic spheres start to claw back to life, with academies and universities slowly filling back in and various small political notions evolving amongst people. By luring parts of intelligentsia back to our country, we can start to properly revert the brain drain in our lands."
 military_grade_computing:"Military-Grade Government Computing & Advanced Military Development Sectors"
 military_grade_computing_desc:"As we've evolved into a proper state, our need for computing power, room for data storage and a proper military development sector in the government has increased tenfold.

 improvised_radio:"Civilian Radio & Radar Technology"
 improvised_radio_desc:"As Poland vanished, so did most of its military infrastructure and equipment - most army facilities have been robbed clean or thrashed completely, leaving us only with civilian radios (usually household ones or old, portable ones used by fishing grandpas), walkie-takies used by kids and few civilian radars that usually serve single, very specific purposes. Thankfully, most cliques in Poland are as ragtag as us, so currently we're fine with civilian radios and radars that have been tinkered with to adapt them for army purposes."
 radio:0 "Cold War-Era Radio & Radar Technology"
 radio_desc:0 "With more proper military equipment in our hands, the need for purpose-made military devices increases, as much of our new equipment requires their functions to work, forcing us to acquire cheap, old radios, radars and other measurement and detection systems from abroad. New radios will make communication between various sectors of the army easier, and new detection devices will allow us to set up some proper (if VERY old by today's standards) defensive systems and intel acquisition systems on our turf, to further secure our hold over it."
 battlefield_management_systems:"Modern Battlefield Management Systems"
 battlefield_management_systems_desc:"A battlefield management system - BMS for short - is a system meant to integrate information acquisition and processing to enhance command and control of a military unit.

 air_radio_control_3:0 "Cold War-Era Air Radar"
 air_radio_control_3_desc:0 "Cheap military air radars that - given their age and Soviet origins - were probably used back in the Polish People's Army before getting sold and then bought back to Poland. Obviously, they're completely terrible compared to modern detection techniques."

 vpn_and_tor_desc:"To further secure our data, we can employ cheaply available civilian-grade encryption techniques, such as using VPNs and onion routing. A proper government whould still have an easy time finding our Internet activity, but for Polish standards such measures will be more than enough. \n\nNow comes the hard part, however: how do we teach 60 years old clerks on how to use Tor?"
 not_pegasus:"Spyware & Cyber-Surveillance"
 not_pegasus_desc:"Back in the day when Poland existed, it's government employed Pegasus for surveilling opposition groups. Whatever our stance on governmental spyware is, we cannot deny that it whould come in handy, and it whould be highly useful for national security and espionage purposes. We can sacrifice some money to buy one of these spyware programs and deploy them to spy on enemy cliques. Or our own citizens."

 adhoc_trollbrigades_desc:"Cold War has ruined the public image of wars. World order set in 2001 started to break down and now people start to thirst for blood of others once more, yet war is still percieved as an ugly, and - most importantly - a very unnecessary thing. Because of that, every modern country that gets into conflicts with others employs internet trolls to sway people to their side and cover any mishaps that happened while they were enforcing their will upon others. We should do the same - let's recruit some people to start spreading propaganda in social media to turn people against our enemies and to make ourselves look better in their eyes."
 internet_troll_agencies:"Professional Troll Brigades"
 internet_troll_agencies_desc:"Amateurish trolls can be useful, but over time people start to realise they're just shouting things on the Internet. Professional troll agencies, however, are able to sow so much disinformation and chaos in the Web to affect politics in other countries and create loyalists that support foreign regimes with their lives despite never having any contact with them or their countries. The past Russian government has mastered this technique, employing internet troll farms to dictate how anti-American politics are conducted on the Internet, and we should establish similar troll cells in our government to sow foreign support for our cause."
 ai_trollbots:"AI Trollbots & Troll Brigades"
 ai_trollbots_desc:"The early '20s were a period of major development of machine learning bots. Bots of all kinds - image-creating bots, chat bots, and of course - trollbots. Trollbots that were fed with so many data samples, that they were almost able to pass the Turing test, as shown by a bot fed with samples from /pol/ that managed to fool many 4chan users into thinking that it's a real person. Over years, more and more such bots were employed by troll farms to spread agendas over the Internet, therefore, to increase the effeciency of our troll agencies, we should start investing into bots (let's start with simple ones) helping with sowing chaos in Internet discourses."
 advanced_ai_trollbots:"Professionally-Made AI Trollbots & Troll Brigades"
 advanced_ai_trollbots_desc:"An advanced, machine-learning algorythm - a perfect propaganda machine, that lures edgy American teenargers and 'woke' horoscope-reading spiritualists into sacrificing their hearts and minds for an agenda that was made up by a bunch of old men fighting a war in Central Europe. If we were to find the right person that could create a bot like this for our purposes, our government's trolls could multiply the effectiveness and the reach of our troll agencies by tenfolds and potentially creating a permament mark in Internet politics and worldviews."
