 POZ_divided_city_desc:0 "Poznań, a city with centuries of glorious history, is now divided, if only for the fact that it suffered a lot during the Fall and the chaos afterwards. Only the north-eastern part of Poznań remained under the authority of the democratic president Jaskowiak - the southern part of the city was overrun by bandits, anarchists and rappers and their fans, while the western part, as a result of the intervention of the Union, came under the authority of the Eurokommissariat of Western Poland, headed by president Jaskowiak's former friend, Donald Tusk. The fact that our city is so divided makes reconstruction, communication and the lives of ordinary citizens more difficult."

However, the increasingly anti-religious stance of the government is arousing more and more indignation among ordinary citizens. Parts of the government are also keen on partial cooperation with the Church."

 POZ_the_last_stand_of_democracy_desc:0 "As a result of the actions of the authoritarian Law and Justice government, Polish democracy has collapsed. Despite the intervention of the European Union, it was not possible to save it, and so we have become one of the last places where democracy has survived. In spite of this, however, we must remain strong in the belief that the democratic order, the free principles of the Western world and human rights will return to all parts of our country. Our country is, by the way, headed by a man who has stood firmly for democracy for more than 10 years - President Jacek Jaskova. Under his leadership, we will not easily let the remnants of Polish democracy be destroyed."

 POZ_contact_westpolen_desc:0 "Poznan after the Fall of Poland was never a place where large armed forces were stationed. Its security structure was based on police forces and the support of the Eurocomisarist boss, Donald Tusk, a close associate of our President. In the current situation, when we are threatened by clouds of religious fanatics and Big Brother in the West is experiencing moments of difficulty, the inhabitants of the City are increasingly concerned. Assistance, even if symbolic, from Eurocomisarist would be of great help in calming the public mood and equipping at least part of our modest forces with decent armaments."

 POZ_proposition_of_normalisation_desc:0 "Thanks to the fact that they have begun to establish peaceful relations with the Slums, we can go one step further, and propose the peaceful unification of the Slums into our state. Of course, this will be a compromise unification, however, we cannot allow a renewed intervention in Ratya, which could slow down our next actions, and bring huge losses in both our army and civilian losses. We must therefore make a deal with Peja, provided he agrees to our move."

Although we need to make them aware of the stakes they are fighting for, but when we do this, our army will gain many warriors who will always be ready to give their lives for our cause."

Our troops, standing in the streets of the Old Town and Łacina, are fully ready for action, and thanks to the actions of our activists, the residents of the slum-occupied districts are ready to help our troops if necessary. The time of lawlessness is over, it is time to bring order, democracy and freedom back to southern Poznan."

Through our actions, we managed to create our small but sufficient army, capable of restoring democracy locally. Thanks to our actions, we have managed to restore the inhabitants' faith in democracy, freedom and President Jaskowiak, which has diminished in recent years. So we should not remain on our laurels, and prepare for our next step - to take back western Poznan from the power of Jehovah's crazies"

poznan.1.t:0 "The Work of the Persistent"
poznan.1.desc:0 "It was 11am. The weather was sunny with a bit of wind, and the temperature did not exceed 8 degrees. People began to slowly gather in front of the city hall on Kolegiacki Square. About 20 minutes later, President Jacek Jaskowiak emerged from City Hall surrounded by more important officials and security guards from the Poznan army. He looked visibly more tired than ever before, clearly having worked hard to maintain his small city-state, and to make it stronger in tough times, particularly with the loss of most of Poznan. He approached the rostrum with a confident yet calm step, saw the hour on his watch, stood over the rostrum for a while still, until he said: \n\n`Dear Poznanians and Poznanians, Citizens and Citizens of our state, all Soldiers, dear Friends...'. \n\nYour courage and your dedication to the democratic and Polish cause allowed us to hold on in a difficult moment, despite adversity and chaos all around, which also had its effects on us. However, despite the loss of so many neighborhoods, so many streets, so many houses, blocks or factories. However, we have not lost our spirit, our dedication, and our devotion to our cause has become stronger, for our mission is more important than ever. I am sure that the fact of the rapid reconstruction of basic infrastructure, basic services, making it possible to live a peaceful life for these times is due to you, and you have set an example of heroism. So I am confident that we will be able to completely control the chaos in the future to restore democracy and social order, so necessary in the daily lives of ordinary citizens.' \n\nThe speech lasted a total of 15 minutes. After the speech, Preyzdent Jaskowiak, surrounded by his colleagues, the soldiers of the Poznan army, who were personally commanded by our commander-in-chief, Gen. Miroslaw Rozanski, proceeded to Freedom Square. Along with the President's procession marched several hundred activists, democratic activists, and ordinary residents, who joined the President in increasing numbers. The march lasted about 15 minutes, during which the presidential procession walked along Water Street, the southern part of the Old Market Square, which until recently had been completely ditched, though not at all ideal in its current state still. Behind the Old Market Square, the procession passed through Ignacy Jan Paderewski Street, from which it had already entered Liberty Square, there Jacek Jaskowiak said aloud: \n\n'Long Live the Warriors for Democracy and Freedom, who did not live to see the return of a democratic, sovereign Poland in accordance with human rights.'' \n\nAfter that, surrounded by soldiers, he laid a wreath at the Stone commemorating those who died for democracy. Behind the president, officials laid a wreath, along with his deputy and prime minister of our state, Mariusz Wisniewski. Further wreaths were laid by other officials of our city, and the military in the form of Generals Miroslaw Rozanski and Adam Duda. About five minutes later, the ceremony ended, and President Jaskowiak, this time by car, returned to City Hall where he then returned to his paperwork."
