 POZ_divided_city:0 "Divided City" 
 POZ_divided_city_desc:0 "Poznań, a city with centuries of glorious history, is now divided, if only for the fact that it suffered a lot during the Fall and the chaos afterwards. Only the north-eastern part of Poznań remained under the authority of the democratic president Jaskowiak - the southern part of the city was overrun by bandits, anarchists and rappers and their fans, while the western part, as a result of the intervention of the Union, came under the authority of the Eurokommissariat of Western Poland, headed by president Jaskowiak's former friend, Donald Tusk. The fact that our city is so divided makes reconstruction, communication and the lives of ordinary citizens more difficult."

 POZ_anti_religious_fervor_desc:0 "Even before the collapse, the municipal authorities as well as the public were becoming increasingly hostile towards religion, but after the Fall the anti-religious sentiment of the authorities strengthened. However, the increasingly anti-religious stance of the government is arousing more and more indignation among ordinary citizens. Parts of the government are also keen on partial cooperation with the Church."

 POZ_the_last_stand_of_democracy:0 "The Last Stand of Democracy"
 POZ_the_last_stand_of_democracy_desc:0 "As a result of the actions of the authoritarian Law and Justice government, Polish democracy has collapsed. Despite the intervention of the European Union, it was not possible to save it, and so we have become one of the last places where democracy has survived. In spite of this, however, we must remain strong in the belief that the democratic order, the free principles of the Western world and human rights will return to all parts of our country. Our country is, by the way, headed by a man who has stood firmly for democracy for more than 10 years - President Jacek Jaskova. Under his leadership, we will not easily let the remnants of Polish democracy be destroyed."
 POZ_stranded_in_madlands:0 "Stranded in the Madlands"
 POZ_stranded_in_madlands_desc:0 "The collapse of the state meant that instead of democratic neighbors, we found ourselves surrounded by relics of the Middle Ages, a state of chaos, and democratic and friendly towards us Eurocommissariats in the east, but these have their own internal problems, and it is unclear whether another state of madmen and schizophrenics will not grow up there as well. \n\nThe feeling of being a cauldron of democracy and normalcy, however, makes us stronger in the depths of our hearts, because no one wants us to fall from a country of freedom into a country of enslavement, dictatorship, or social backwardness."
 POZ_contact_westpolen:0 "Contact Westpolen"
 POZ_contact_westpolen_desc:0 "Poznan after the Fall of Poland was never a place where large armed forces were stationed. Its security structure was based on police forces and the support of the Eurocomisarist boss, Donald Tusk, a close associate of our President. In the current situation, when we are threatened by clouds of religious fanatics and Big Brother in the West is experiencing moments of difficulty, the inhabitants of the City are increasingly concerned. Assistance, even if symbolic, from Eurocomisarist would be of great help in calming the public mood and equipping at least part of our modest forces with decent armaments."

 POZ_approach_the_slums:0 "Approach the Slums"
 POZ_approach_the_slums_desc:0 "To the south of our state are the so-called Slums of Poznan. We have to decide what we will do about them - whether to try to compromise with them or to take back the districts of our city occupied by them by force of arms."
 POZ_establish_a_bike_supplylines:0 "Establish Bike Supply Lines"
 POZ_establish_a_bike_supplylines_desc:0 "We have problems getting supplies to our units, or civilian facilities. However, we are, thanks to a sizable supply of bicycles to remedy this - it is on the basis of these that we would reconstitute our supply lines anywhere in our country. We have enough bicycles and people to do this, so nothing stands in the way of this."
 POZ_trade_with_benefits:0 "Trade with Benefits"
 POZ_trade_with_benefits_desc:0 "The first step in getting closer to the Slums and establishing peaceful relations should be to establish trade relations between us. Both countries would benefit from this."
 POZ_proposition_of_normalisation:0 "Proposition of Normalisation"
 POZ_proposition_of_normalisation_desc:0 "Thanks to the fact that they have begun to establish peaceful relations with the Slums, we can go one step further, and propose the peaceful unification of the Slums into our state. Of course, this will be a compromise unification, however, we cannot allow a renewed intervention in Ratya, which could slow down our next actions, and bring huge losses in both our army and civilian losses. We must therefore make a deal with Peja, provided he agrees to our move."
 POZ_urban_warrior_of_democracy:0 "Urban Warriors of Democracy"
 POZ_urban_warrior_of_democracy_desc:0 "Thanks to the fact that Peja has agreed to join us, we are able to incorporate into our army previous Slum warriors who, when they know what they are fighting for, fight fiercely to the end, such warriors will be very useful to us in the current situation. Although we need to make them aware of the stakes they are fighting for, but when we do this, our army will gain many warriors who will always be ready to give their lives for our cause."
 POZ_set_the_police_along_the_lines:0 "Set up the Police Along the Lines"
 POZ_set_the_police_along_the_lines_desc:0 "Our decision of the last debate in the city hall building is that we can't make any deals with the terrorists who have brought massive social chaos to the south. In view of this, we urgently need to move a large number of our police forces to the south, as part of guarding the southern border from the gathering of military troops near it, which will put an end to the life of the rebellious savagery."
 POZ_last_day_of_slums_anarchy:0 "Last Days of the Slums Anarchy"
 POZ_last_day_of_slums_anarchy_desc:0 "The time has come to pacify the rebellious anarchists in Rataje and Wilda. Our troops, standing in the streets of the Old Town and Łacina, are fully ready for action, and thanks to the actions of our activists, the residents of the slum-occupied districts are ready to help our troops if necessary. The time of lawlessness is over, it is time to bring order, democracy and freedom back to southern Poznan."
 POZ_pacification_force:0 "Pacification Forces"
 POZ_pacification_force_desc:0 "After reclaiming Rataj, Chartow and Wilda, it is time to restore order.

 POZ_set_a_good_example:0 "Set a Good Example"
 POZ_set_a_good_example_desc:0 "Our popularity and the population's hope for a better tomorrow declined, along with the collapse. Saying good words to boost their spirits will be a good idea."

 POZ_nationalisation_of_bikes:0 "Nationalisation of Bikes"
 POZ_nationalisation_of_bikes_desc:0 "In order to strengthen our army, we are being forced to introduce an act to nationalise all private bicycles in East Poznan. As bicycles have been a very popular means of transport in our city for many years, this will strengthen our army through a large number of bicycles, which can then be used as a means of transport or by creating special bicycle divisions."
 POZ_district_guard:0 "District guard"
 POZ_district_guard_desc:0 "To support our army, we should create volunteer militia units. Thanks to the fact that the people of our state know about the need to defend and restore democracy, the recruitment and creation of several volunteer units should not go hard."

 POZ_redistribution_of_means_of_transport_desc:0 "The collapse left a lot of immobilized machines, but their role has been mostly taken over by bicycles. We should make a restitution of them to the city's suburbs."

 POZ_contact_the_businessmans_desc:0 "In order to gain the funds needed for the potential war effort, we can contact Poznan businessmen who, despite the economic catastrophe in the form of the collapse of Poland, still have some assets.

 POZ_collect_steel_from_unused_cars:0 "Collect Steel from Inused Cars"
 POZ_collect_steel_from_unused_cars_desc:0 "The period of collapse and chaos has left many cars on the streets, which have lost their owners in various circumstances. We should take advantage of this by dismantling them to get steel for weapons production."

 POZ_were_ready_for_doomsday_desc:0 "Thanks to our actions, we have managed to rebuild eastern Poznan from the devastation left by the chaos and military intervention of the European Union. Through our actions, we managed to create our small but sufficient army, capable of restoring democracy locally. Thanks to our actions, we have managed to restore the inhabitants' faith in democracy, freedom and President Jaskowiak, which has diminished in recent years. So we should not remain on our laurels, and prepare for our next step - to take back western Poznan from the power of Jehovah's crazies."

poznan.1.t:0 "The Work of the Persistent"
poznan.1.desc:0 "It was 11am. The weather was sunny with a bit of wind, and the temperature did not exceed 8 degrees. People began to slowly gather in front of the city hall on Kolegiacki Square. About 20 minutes later, President Jacek Jaskowiak emerged from City Hall surrounded by more important officials and security guards from the Poznan army. He looked visibly more tired than ever before, clearly having worked hard to maintain his small city-state, and to make it stronger in tough times, particularly with the loss of most of Poznan. He approached the rostrum with a confident yet calm step, saw the hour on his watch, stood over the rostrum for a while still, until he said: \n\n`Dear Poznanians and Poznanians, Citizens and Citizens of our state, all Soldiers, dear Friends...'. \n\nYour courage and your dedication to the democratic and Polish cause allowed us to hold on in a difficult moment, despite adversity and chaos all around, which also had its effects on us. However, despite the loss of so many neighborhoods, so many streets, so many houses, blocks or factories. However, we have not lost our spirit, our dedication, and our devotion to our cause has become stronger, for our mission is more important than ever. I am sure that the fact of the rapid reconstruction of basic infrastructure, basic services, making it possible to live a peaceful life for these times is due to you, and you have set an example of heroism. So I am confident that we will be able to completely control the chaos in the future to restore democracy and social order, so necessary in the daily lives of ordinary citizens.' \n\nThe speech lasted a total of 15 minutes. After the speech, Preyzdent Jaskowiak, surrounded by his colleagues, the soldiers of the Poznan army, who were personally commanded by our commander-in-chief, Gen. Miroslaw Rozanski, proceeded to Freedom Square. Along with the President's procession marched several hundred activists, democratic activists, and ordinary residents, who joined the President in increasing numbers. The march lasted about 15 minutes, during which the presidential procession walked along Water Street, the southern part of the Old Market Square, which until recently had been completely ditched, though not at all ideal in its current state still. Behind the Old Market Square, the procession passed through Ignacy Jan Paderewski Street, from which it had already entered Liberty Square, there Jacek Jaskowiak said aloud: \n\n'Long Live the Warriors for Democracy and Freedom, who did not live to see the return of a democratic, sovereign Poland in accordance with human rights.'' \n\nAfter that, surrounded by soldiers, he laid a wreath at the Stone commemorating those who died for democracy. Behind the president, officials laid a wreath, along with his deputy and prime minister of our state, Mariusz Wisniewski. Further wreaths were laid by other officials of our city, and the military in the form of Generals Miroslaw Rozanski and Adam Duda. About five minutes later, the ceremony ended, and President Jaskowiak, this time by car, returned to City Hall where he then returned to his paperwork."

poznan.19.desc:0 "Our forces knew what could happen, and were ready for it. Their commander, Major Tomasz Poręba, informed them that it was not decent for us to negotiate and discuss with traitors and fanatics in the form of the Catholic Church, hostile to our ideals, and our dreams of freedom. Major Poręba also said that personally the commander of our army, General Miroslaw Różanski, ordered his unit to carry out an assault on the most important and most static temple in the city, the Cathedral on Ostrow Tumski. \n\nSince Major Poreba's unit was regarded as one of the most cathartic and radical in its quest to restore freedom and democracy, all the soldiers welcomed the order with pleasure in their souls, preparing to carry it out. The unit's staff worked out a plan to enter the building, secure it, get the people out and control it, and when the plan was ready, the soldiers began to practice it. \n\nA day later, the unit was ready for action, so that after sending a message about it to the president and the army command, the unit left on bicycles for the city, in the direction of Ostrów Tumski\n\nThis journey, went smoothly. Immediately at the gate to the church, the soldiers stopped, secured their bicycles, took their rifles in hand, and on the major's orders began to move slowly toward the main entrance. There, Major Poreba, his adjutant, deputy and 3 other soldiers went inside, right in the middle of the mass. One of the soldiers fired a shot into the ceiling, which frightened the people, but not the priest. He was then approached by Major Poreba, who, calling him an 'anti-liberal, fanatical pig,' punched him in the face with all his might, with which he knocked him over, but failed to soften him up. The major then began his own speech, according to which entering the temple was a necessary act because of the growing threat from the anti-democratic conspiracy of the church from wanting, like our neighbors in Gniezno and Środa, to restore the middleages, enslave women and ordinary people, or destroy everything that modern society has built. Immediately after that, another 10 soldiers entered the temple and arrested the priests present in the church and the sacristy. There were a total of 7 people, who were led outside the church with their hands up. They were then taken to a prison for traitors to the democratic Polish cause. \n\nA few hours after the action, President Jaskowiak arrived at the cathedral surrounded by the government. There he pondered what to do with the building once it was no longer in use by the church authorities."
