THE_MGMT_DESC:0 "The collapse of Poland almost also meant the collapse of KGHM. The combine lost all of their investors - both foreign and local ones. Most stock exchanges started considering pulling it from their lists, and all state support also ended. The chairmen, however, had a different plan on how to handle things, and instead of shutting KGHM's operations down, they focused on maintaining a steady source of income - especially to their workers, as the company's whole plan was based on their loyalty and trust in their higher-ups. So - they made an agreement with EK: the workers of KGHM will be paid good pensions and will be protected from any threats and the copper will be sold to Europe (mainly Germany) at fairly low, non-negotiable prices. Of course, to ensure the EU will cooperate, some Eurobureaucrats were seated in the board. \n\nJudging by the newly installed copper town signs appearing across the region, their plan for survival more than worked - to the point where the company board seems to perceive the downfall of the Eurokommissariat not as a danger to the combine, but rather as an opportunity to expand their area of operation. Now, KGHM workers proudly rush to work in a new, unusual for their craft environment, equipped with combat helmets and rifles bearing the KGHM logo, alongside retreating EK soldiers bribed to serve as mercenaries to secure the Copper Valley region. With the help of Technological Department, KGHM is able to flourish and develop lands associated with them once again, winning the loyalty and trust of those who find themselves under their management.\n\nUnfortunately, the lack of new clients, problems with nearby warlords and the local Roma population are increasingly worrying the board..."
THE_SCIENTIFIC_INSTITUTE_DESC:0 "The Technology Department was established early after the Fall, from the existing Polish scientists working in KGHM plants, as a response to current problems. Their immediate help was needed to modernize copper mining and smelting, to maintain the machinery, and above all to support by all means an acceptable level of workers satisfaction and their standard of living. Scientific achievements of the departament substantially helped the combine to get back on its feet and avoid bankruptcy... Without Tech Department, §tKGHM would fall like Poland did.§! \n\nNow, the new Scientific Institute transformed into a supervisory board is setting course for all the citizens of the combine. The board solves the problems of the state in the way of solving scientific problems. There is no shortage of disputes and proving mistakes, but in the event of an impasse, the final decision is made by the chief director.\nBased on statistics and complex calculations, the institute is able to make the best choice in everything from extraction, production, through the sales chain, to the safety and well-being of the company and the population."
THE_CORE_DESC:0 "Center of all of operations, where thoughts of all of the brightest flow freely without any biological or physical constraints. Founded by a genius who did not want all the glory for himself, he did the opposite - he merged his mind with all Polish minds, intentionally rejecting his objective self, leaving only his consciousness as a flash in this great creation.\n\nIf you could look at a Think Tank, it would look like a great metropolis of brains, stretched-out neural fibers, the circuits that bind and connect them all, energy-storing cells, and the squeaking and buzzing noises that accompany them, all covered in a glass cylinder set on a large circular metal base.\nThe brains and the biological parts are just vessels, the remnants of each's biological identity, but their presence of mind is in a different place. A single consciousness can move individually whenever and wherever it thinks, without the limitations imposed by nature on us.\n\nHowever, in the combined consciousness they are all together, gathered and attracted by the Great Copper Obelisk inside the tank. All important decisions regarding the security, expansion and future of the new form of existence are made here. - this is the center of The Core - Poland itself!"

CHLUDZINSKI_DESC:0 "§LThe CEO of the combine - a devoted man of quality, respected by the employees of the company. It was he who was able to steer KGHM under the harsh occupation of the Eurokommissariat Schlesien and keep everything together when everything started to fall apart again. It was he, as a very good organizer, but also a man who was able to win the loyalty of almost everyone, who was the spiritus movens and real manager of rebuilding the stability and growing wealth of the combine.\nNow dark times have come for the chief chairman, but nobody cannot call him submissive and indecisive in facing all the bad that is ahead. His hard actions and soft words can shape the future of the entire company.  It is only important that he keeps his head on his shoulders despite the various voices of important people in the ever-changing scene of the copper combine.§!"
KSENBOK_DESC:0 "§LLoyal to the company from the beginning. He's not a man with golden lips like his boss-colleague, but he makes up for it with his sense of reading the other party and making the best deals. He’s the organizer of all of the biggest and most profitable KGHMs sales and contracts. Shortly absent in EK phase, which resulted from a conflict with the authorities of the Kommissariat, He came back from his time in occupiers' custody, which left him with a certain hidden stain on his mind, to his good old master contractor position.\nAfter the Fall selling copper and other rarer metals is quite a challenging task. Roads and railways are often dangerous and they are groups that are willing to steal those goods, but overall with many former clients in other warring states and rapidly arming local armies, there’s always a great opportunity to make a deal with these precious resources.§!"
BUGAJCZUK_DESC:0 "§LMr. Bugajczuk isn't a pre-Fall Member of the Board, he wasn't even a worker of the combine. Instead, he served in the army and then in various types of property security agencies in many dangerous places around the world. After the withdrawal of the Eurokommissariat's forces, he returned feeling an opportunity to earn money by offering his sought-after skills in training and managing military units.\nFrom the remnants of the EKS army, which had nothing to lose, and mostly local volunteers, he formed the defense units of the KGHM, especially now as never will they be needed in this dangerous area and testing time for the combine.\nChief of Security's loyalty is not questioned by the Board, especially since the soldiers are mostly employees of the company. However, no one knows for sure how much he can be trusted with such a responsible task.§!"
SWIDER_DESC:0 "§LResponsible for maintaining and expanding mines and also transporting ores to the furnaces of the copperworks. It is the most important task of the combine to constantly pump the white-hot blood into its copper heart, giving jobs and thus livelihoods to thousands of people in the region.\nŚwider is trusted and his employees find him a very reliable man who cares for the safety of underground and high-temperature works. Even despite the post-Fall cost cuts. He did not let most of the occupational OHS positions be vacated and safety measures removed.\nHaving much experience from many years of work as a regular miner and later visiting mines in all of the World, from South America through ZFN to famous Australian opencast mines, he knows the best possible way to extract ore to the surface.§!"

THE_DIRECTOR_DESC:0 "§LThe Main Director is not very charismatic for a team leader, but rather a silent - task type with a great attitude to his projects and the company’s goals. Even if not very social he likes to listen to the team, their constantly popping up ideas and to evaluate their job with a great deal of criticism but also very accurate advice. Thus he is regarded more as a mentor, than as the head of the company. However, this does not depreciate his leadership abilities, when he talked with the chairmen, despite his frequent silence and mediocre charm, he could stand up for his right like a lion and often do things without the consent of his superiors.\nNow, He's the backbone of the Technology Department and its new rule. Thanks to his professionalism, commitment and authority the rest of the Technological Board has high hopes for the renewed KGHM, even if sometimes he seems absent, somewhere very far away with his thoughts among people.§!"
THE_RIGHTHAND_SCIENTIST_DESC:0 "§LBorn in a small village in eastern Poland, from his earliest years he was seen as a child genius. With extremely good grades he was invited to one of the best engineering university in the country, where he choose a specialization in heavy machinery and the usage of robotics in the metal industry. Thanks to his groundbreaking solutions, he quickly climbed to a high position in the Technological Department of the combine. Maybe his fascination with robots is sometimes too intense, but when the results are promising, frills go aside.\nHe is somewhat similar and somewhat exact opposite, not resembling anyone, and sometimes on the same wave as the main director. Full of ideas and energy to implement them in life. Tempered by the rest of the team, but got the green light from the main director who allows him to work in his chaotic style.§!"
THE_DEP_ORGANISER_DESC:0 "§LThe best organizer of the flow of funds and resources in the Department, and now the entire combine. She can put even the boss in a straight line, especially when he experiences his moments of absenteeism, or disconnects with young Walter to ponder some hellish ideas. Sometimes the all-time tired doctor has to manage all the company paperwork herself when the rest of the board disappears. Still, her professionalism and perfectionism prevent her from following the path of fellow scientists\nDespite everything, she likes working in this team. She is appreciated by the rest of the staff and most of those who have contact with her for her firmness and discipline, but also not a tyrannical attitude.§!"
THE_MERCENARY_MANAGER_DESC:0 "§LThis man always knows what he is doing, but he does not always agree to perform a task. He's the 'no' vote, but he's not the brakeman.  He is often the voice of reason, the voice of employees, and the voice of other people, which is why, apart from the Board, he enjoys considerable popularity. He often sits in a factory bar where he draws in his notebook while drinking vodka or beer, or talks to dirty workers about their current problems and tries to improve their conditions and safety\nWhen it comes to an argument, watch out for flying objects, because Stanisław Braun is as tough and unyielding as a rock. He remains in the team, not only because of his competence, but because the main director sees him as the guardian of the combine's common sense. Literally and figuratively.§!"

THE_PROCESSOR_DESC:0 "§LThat’s the main part of the Machine of Poland, the massive steep holding everything together, cast by the great heavy-duty robots of different shapes and purposes, supervised by the last biological engineers. The circular base has about 5 kilometers in diameter and the height of the structure surrounding the Tank is massive at over a hundred meters, fortified with concrete and automatic turrets. Thousands of kilometers of wires go through the Processor connecting all of our radars, maintenance stations, local defense systems and of course industry and laboratories.\nThe Processor is a giant computer itself that maintains dozens of hundreds of drones and robots, all of the crucial infrastructure and manages the rest of computing structures and programs. But other than that, it's a virtual and of course psychical barrier defending The Core.§!"
THE_CALCULATOR_DESC:0 "§LThe Machine of Poland is always working and therefore always counting. The Processor is already occupied by overall governing computing, so researchers of the Board developed The Great Calculator. This part of combined machinery is focused on production and extraction prognosis, worker drones management, issues of optimal materials preservation, consumption of energy resources and other more industrious and logistic matters.\nIts cubical, monumental and tall shape mourns above ever misted grounds of Polish Central Lowland. Never-ending, regular computing clicks are disturbed only by occasional maintenance drones and harmless forms of life barely visible in clouds of mist, rising through the massive ventilation channels of the cooling system.§!"
THE_GUARDIAN_DESC:0 "§LThis is the autonomous defense system capable of maintaining Poland's safety. Its two main goals are to defend The Core and to secure all of the former Polish lands.\nThe Guardian Of Land and Electronic Modules also called§! §tGlobal Offensive Launch and Engagement Mechanism§! §L(in more crisis situations) is a program controlling all of the assault robots, cyber servile forces, autonomous land vehicles, aviation, reconnaissance and combat drones, even missiles and high-risk armament.\n His additional task is constantly searching for rebellious elements who don’t want to cooperate and find egoistic biological life better than merging into the power of eternal thought and singularity. System-guided catchers-drones with infrared and sound sensors show optimal results for this task.§!"
THE_DIPLOMAT_DESC:0 "§LWhile projecting the future of Poland, Technological Board  has not forgotten other countries, their obscurant people and ignorant leaders. So The Diplomacy Algorithm was born - nicknamed The Diplomat. It’s a system which has been programmed to analyze people speech, intentions, body language or actions, based on the most modern psychological behavioral models, then to make moves statistically most advantageous for the Polish cause.\nError margin is less than significant and still decreases, because of neuronal self-learning program which constantly analyzes in current time, and it's structure expands with each transferred mind.\nWith the computing power of The Machine, it can become a very persuasive voice.§!"

unification.48.desc:0 "The latest news informs about the full control of the former Lower Silesian Voivodeship by the copper conglomerate KGHM. The firm got in charge of the cities in the so-called Copper Valley, and after the heroic defense against a Gypsy rebellion, they grew to be a strong state in the subregion in a very short time.\n\nKGHM survived the Fall of Poland and very quickly secured its position with dedicated soldier-made workers, post-EKS mercenaries and above all - thanks to the powerful economic machine that provides the masses with housing, food, energy, stable employment, healthcare and even luxury goods from foreign exchanges. The conglomerate rules the state through the company's supervisory board. The technique of total control over the economy to ensure economic growth is carried out by buying out all enterprises existing in Lower Silesia and also economically encouraging everyone to work in various branches of KGHM's mega-enterprise."

unificationreg.48.desc:0 "Copper Mining and Metallurgical Combine - KGHM assured administrative and military control over the Lower Silesian-Lubuskie region. Company units secure all borders of industrial creation, and accounting and management staff at all levels work hard to maintain legal and fiscal order.\n\nAt first, the small area occupied by the combine was immediately torn apart by a civil war with the local Roma population, with time there were more and more adversaries until today when a small copper spot has spilled out to a significant size in Poland divided into districts. The Board does everything so that the industry does not stop even for a moment, and the sellers do not stop calling potential customers so that only thanks to this the state has the funds needed for expansion.\nThe seemingly small technological branch of the company has now grown thanks to the debut of their inventions. Its groundbreaking works constantly increase the processing, transport and very importantly - military capabilities of KGHM. Which will soon be put to the test again."

unificationsupreg.48.desc:0 "The main spokesperson of the newly refitted KGHM announced in front of the new headquarters, that combine is entering a new phase of planning and business development. After a recent incident involving friction with a belligerent Department of Technology and a cyber-panic among the workers and in the army, the situation is now under control and everything goes back to normal.\n\nThe society in reborn Poland, built on masts and scaffoldings made of copper, is brave and eager to complete the sacred task entrusted to them. No one forced them to do so, and yet, under their confident management, they chose a difficult role instead of giving up and going to waste as citizens of the former Rzeczpospolita.\n"Now greatness and prosperity are within our reach." continued the spokesman confidently. The crowd of miners and copper casters shouted with joy and rejoiced to see the management seated in the stands. The CEO and associates were showered with thunderous applause. Although reporters add about groups of less positive people who were very quickly surrounded by private company military units and herded with brutal accuracy to less visible places.\n"However, there is nothing to worry about in a country built on copper, where every worker has ensured security, a job and a decent life." - Ended spokesman."

super.48.t:0 "[GetNewspaper]Final stage of KGHM's Great Copper Plan"
super.48.desc:0 "The Full-metal Mining and Metallurgical Combine of Poland got sovereignty over the state. The first parade of this type in Poland (and probably in the world), when convoys of excavators, winches, giant transporters and industrial machines of all kinds swept through Warsaw. Most people stood stunned as these giants in the company colors of copper and silver showed the glory of the unifiers of the homeland. The joy, if any, faded rather quickly, and the streets quickly became empty. Time in the new combine state is national money, so everyone had to go back to their duties..\n\nWith mechanical pragmatism, very quickly every citizen got an "offer" of work in the company or its subordinate enterprises. With the current prices and the system of discounts for employees, only the richest could afford the autonomous possibility of getting money in the way they choose.\nProtests against the new order of the combine authorities were quickly broken up by the reinforced combine troops. Their professionalism and efficiency long ago surpassed the former incompetence of a bunch of militia and depraved mercenaries.\nRather no one else will try to disturb the stability that the Board will ensure for everyone. After all, stability and reliable economic development are a guarantee of the cohesion of the newly reborn state. And copper, after a long time after processing, hardens terribly and is increasingly difficult to modify, unless it breaks into small pieces."
