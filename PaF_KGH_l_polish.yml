THE_MGMT_DESC:0 "The collapse of Poland almost also meant the collapse of KGHM. The combine lost all of their investors - both foreign and local ones. Most stock exchanges started considering pulling it from their lists, and all state support also ended. The chairmen, however, had a different plan on how to handle things, and instead of shutting KGHM's operations down, they focused on maintaining a steady source of income - especially to their workers, as the company's whole plan was based on their loyalty and trust in their higher-ups. So - they made an agreement with EK: the workers of KGHM will be paid good pensions and will be protected from any threats and the copper will be sold to Europe (mainly Germany) at fairly low, non-negotiable prices. Of course, to ensure the EU will cooperate, some Eurobureaucrats were seated in the board. \n\nJudging by the newly installed copper town signs appearing across the region, their plan for survival more than worked - to the point where the company board seems to perceive the downfall of the Eurokommissariat not as a danger to the combine, but rather as an opportunity to expand their area of operation. Now, KGHM workers proudly rush to work in a new, unusual for their craft environment, equipped with combat helmets and rifles bearing the KGHM logo, alongside retreating EK soldiers bribed to serve as mercenaries to secure the Copper Valley region. With the help of Technological Department, KGHM is able to flourish and develop lands associated with them once again, winning the loyalty and trust of those who find themselves under their management.\n\nUnfortunately, the lack of new clients, problems with nearby warlords and the local Roma population are increasingly worrying the board..."

THE_CORE_DESC:0 "Center of all of operations, where thoughts of all of the brightest flow freely without any biological or physical constraints. Founded by a genius who did not want all the glory for himself, he did the opposite - he merged his mind with all Polish minds, intentionally rejecting his objective self, leaving only his consciousness as a flash in this great creation.\n\nIf you could look at a Think Tank, it would look like a great metropolis of brains, stretched-out neural fibers, the circuits that bind and connect them all, energy-storing cells, and the squeaking and buzzing noises that accompany them, all covered in a glass cylinder set on a large circular metal base.\nThe brains and the biological parts are just vessels, the remnants of each's biological identity, but their presence of mind is in a different place. A single consciousness can move individually whenever and wherever it thinks, without the limitations imposed by nature on us.\n\nHowever, in the combined consciousness they are all together, gathered and attracted by the Great Copper Obelisk inside the tank. All important decisions regarding the security, expansion and future of the new form of existence are made here. - this is the center of the Core - Poland itself!"

THE_SCIENTIFIC_INSTITUTE_DESC:0 "The Technology Department was established early after the Fall, from the existing Polish scientists working in KGHM plants, as a response to current problems. Their immediate help was needed to modernize copper mining and smelting, to maintain the machinery, and above all to support by all means an acceptable level of workers satisfaction and their standard of living. Scientific achievements of the departament substantially helped the combine to get back on its feet and avoid bankruptcy... Without Tech Department, §tKGHM would fall like Poland did.§! \n\nNow, the new Scientific Institute transformed into a supervisory board is setting course for all the citizens of the combine. The board solves the problems of the state in the way of solving scientific problems. There is no shortage of disputes and proving mistakes, but in the event of an impasse, the final decision is made by the chief director.\nBased on statistics and complex calculations, the institute is able to make the best choice in everything from extraction, production, through the sales chain, to the safety and well-being of the company and the population."

unification.48.desc:0 "The latest news informs about the full control of the former Lower Silesian Voivodeship by the copper conglomerate KGHM. The firm got in charge of the cities in the so-called Copper Valley, and after the heroic defense against a Gypsy rebellion, they grew to be a strong state in the subregion in a very short time.\n\nKGHM survived the Fall of Poland and very quickly secured its position with dedicated soldier-made workers, post-EKS mercenaries and above all - thanks to the powerful economic machine that provides the masses with housing, food, energy, stable employment, healthcare and even luxury goods from foreign exchanges. The conglomerate rules the state through the company's supervisory board. The technique of total control over the economy to ensure economic growth is carried out by buying out all enterprises existing in Lower Silesia and also economically encouraging everyone to work in various branches of KGHM's mega-enterprise."
