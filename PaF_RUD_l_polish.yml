unification.28.t:0 "[GetNewspaper]Miners Union of Ruda Śląska unifies Upper Silesia!"
unification.28.desc:0 "Saint Barbara has blessed her flock from the heavens, allowing the miners to decide the fate of Silesia for themselves. In all cities of the Metropolis, feverish preparations are underway to thank the holy patroness for her support, in the form of the largest parade the mining world has ever seen, marked by a celebratory procession from Gliwice to Katowice. The event will be headed by a great orchestra – one which shall be heard in all of Silesia. At its head stands Hubert Dwornik, known to his countrymen as Bercik, the author of the cunning plan that delivered victory to the citizens of Ruda Śląska. Or perhaps he never had any plan at all? One way or another, the Hanys Boss is now the miner king of all of Upper Silesia, and he definitely has a craving for the entirety of the region. Yet, it remains questionable just how long a state ruled by miner unions can last before inevitably collapsing into internal struggle."
