unification.137.t:0 "[GetNewspaper]Nowa Huta jednoczy Małopolskę!"
unification.137.desc:0 "Through the destruction and disorder it brought upon the population, the Fall has forced the most bitter of rivals to huddle together to survive the carnage. Perhaps no government exemplifies this phenomenon better than the Triumvirate of Nowa Huta – a loose confederation of hooligans belonging to Kraków’s main clubs. And though normally these ultras would be at each others’ throats, they found no other choice but to work together, eventually managing to unify Lesser Poland through sheer brutality. The people of Lesser Poland still find themselves reeling in shock at the sight of their new masters, as instead of order, lawlessness reigns, with raving bands of hooligans terrorizing the population, taking anything they please from the defenseless citizens. Yet, as old grudges reemerge, leading to increased tension and clashes between the teams, the stability of the Triumvirate remains in question, as with each passing day it grows closer to splintering. Perhaps one day it shall only be remembered as a temporary nightmare."
