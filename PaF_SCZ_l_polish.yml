unification.42.t:0 "[GetNewspaper]Republika Nowego Sącza jednoczy Podhale!"
unification.42.desc:0 "As states which bend to the wishes of the common man fall, in their place rises one built for the elite few. Following the overthrow of Nowy Sącz's democratic government by a triumvirate of business magnates, many cynics doubted the viability of the new corporate regime. And yet, no amount of external slander could bring the republic’s downfall, and apparently, neither could Podhale’s warlords. As the hired goons made quick work of untrained militias, it became painfully clear that deep pockets hold more power than the people’s voice. Now, the mountains once more give home to freedom, yet it is not the commoners that are liberated, but rather the markets. For the moment, the corporate overlords seem content to keep their accounts off the region’s labor, yet their appetite can only grow. After all, the riches of Kraków lie ripe for the taking."
