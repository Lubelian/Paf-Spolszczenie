kacap.1.t:0 "News from the East"
kacap.1.desc:0 "In a shattered Poland it is often hard to get information about the political scene abroad. Not counting the rarely working and unstable internet, the country is cut off from the media and news from outside the country. However, from time to time the diesel generators at TVP headquarters have just enough power to maintain the ability of transmitting simple messages through television programmes. As rare as that, it happens that a television fanatic manages to record the latest recording of the “News” on their cable box. Through friends and family the CDs then make rounds and arrive in all corners of the country. In the end, for the n-th time one arrives at Jan Kowalski’s doorstep with a two day delay. The quality is not stunning and the majority of the data was lost in the fifth or sixth copy of the CD.\nHowever, one part of the news from abroad, those that actually interested Jan managed to survive."
kacap.1.a:0 "Wait, what happened?"

kacap.2.t:0 "[GetNewspaper]Standoff in Moscow"
kacap.2.desc:0 "A new anti-corruption regulation package proposed by Navalny has just been accepted by the Duma, and Russia's top players have NOT took to it kindly. \n\nThe new regulations are said to give the president the required tools to control the various subsidiaries of the national treasury in order to investigate and clamp down on any abuses. When asked in an interview which state apparatus will be investigated first, Navalny replied briefly. - ''The Rosguard''. \nGeneral Zolotov - the Rosguard’s leader - quickly struck back at the president in media, with his answer pointing out the amounts of discontent brewing amongst those in charge of various sectors of the Russian state. With more and more big names in the Russian government backing up Zolotov's claims, Navalny's secretaries whimp at the growing amount of names to be crossed out in governmental documents."
kacap.2.a:0 "Navalny's crusade begins."

kacap.7.t:0 "[GetNewspaper]Navalny wins the Second Russian Civil War"
kacap.7.desc:0 "After years of brutal fighting, the Russian Civil War has, at last, come to an end. In a cruel twist of fate, it appears that all the casualties and destruction brought upon the land have been for naught, as the Navalny government has re-established full control over the nation. Abandoned by his most powerful supporters and forced to flee the capital in the wake of the Rosguard crisis, the President was nonetheless able to utilize his loyalist battalions and outmaneuver his squabbling opposition, eroding their forces piece by piece until the final flame of rebellion burnt out. With the conflict serving as the perfect opportunity to purge any internal dissent against him, nobody remains within Russia who could challenge Navalny’s rule. Already, sweeping reforms pass through the Duma with near unanimity, removing the constraints on presidential power. And rumors say this is only the beginning."
kacap.7.a:0 "The path to absolute power lies open."

kacap.8.t:0 "[GetNewspaper]Medvedev wins the Second Russian Civil War"
kacap.8.desc:0 "For over twenty years, Putinism has shackled Russia, the ideology seeping into the very core of the nation even after the deposition of its founder. Despite his best efforts, Navalny’s few years in power would be entirely insufficient to quell the support that the former President still enjoyed among the elites and the common people alike. Lost in his hubris, the wannabe-tsar failed to recognize that all it would take to bring his regime down was a single match – one he would provide himself with his foolish attempt to consolidate power. With Putin preoccupied in Kaliningrad, the task of leading the revolution fell upon Dmitry Medvedev, who utilized his overwhelming base of support to progressively corner Navalny until his ultimate defeat. With Medvedev in the Kremlin once more, this time having truly proven to be deserving of his position, it remains to be seen whether he’ll continue to serve as his master’s loyal lapdog, or whether the new President’s ambitions will lead him to reshaping Russia in his image."
kacap.8.a:0 "An exile returns to his throne."

kacap.9.t:0 "[GetNewspaper]Zolotov wins the Second Russian Civil War"
kacap.9.desc:0 "The Russian Civil War has at last concluded, ended by the same man who started it all those years ago. Of all the factions vying for power in the country, somehow it is Viktor Zolotov’s Rosguard that stands triumphant. With their initial standoff against Navalny’s forces having provided the spark for nationwide rebellion, the unit’s allegiance ended up being a prize fought over by the conflict’s major contenders. In the end, it was Medvedev who secured the force into his camp, although at the cost of great influence for Zolotov. This would prove to be the former President’s undoing, as right on the cusp of his victory, the previously underperforming Rosguard would end up deposing him in a bloody coup. Having spent his whole career as a yes-man, Zolotov now finds himself in charge of the world’s largest country at the time of its greatest strife in nearly a century. It will take a miracle for him to stay on this throne for long."
kacap.9.a:0 "Russia’s future remains bleak, the one chance at revolution squandered."

kacap.10.t:0 "[GetNewspaper]Shoigu wins the Second Russian Civil War"
kacap.10.desc:0 "Normalcy slowly returns to Russia, as the sounds of gunfire, ever-present since the beginning of the civil war, die down at last. Much to the chagrin of the urban elites of Moscow and St. Petersburg, the nation’s new master appears to be none of their bankrolled contenders, but instead a conqueror from the desolate lands of Tuva. Spared from the fiercest fighting of the conflict’s early days, Sergei Shoigu was left free to gather his strength on the country’s periphery. Biding his time, he waited until the right moment to strike, and with the government’s forces expended, Shoigu’s army rode out from the steppes, crushing the depleted remnants of their opposition. Now firmly in charge of Russia, the general announced a temporary suspension of the democratic process in order to stabilize the country. Whether he plans to ever bring it back remains highly doubtful."
kacap.10.a:0 "Peace, upheld by the barrel of a gun."

kacap.11.t:0 "[GetNewspaper]Dugin wins the Second Russian Civil War"
kacap.11.desc:0 "The western world trembles as news of the Russian reunification slowly filter in through the few remaining sources within the war-torn nation. All over Europe viewers watched in horror as Aleksandr Dugin, in front of tens of thousands gathered on the Red Square, declared a new era upon Russia – one of “glorious battle against the existential threat of Atlanticism”. Initially declaring his loyalty to Medvedev’s Republic and serving as one of its most fervent supporters, Dugin used his elevated position to amass influence among the upper echelons of government, eventually rising to power through a coup against the President. Putting his theories of a true pan-Eurasian state into effect, the writer transformed Russia’s very identity, aiming to detach it from western influences. With Dugin’s stated goals of total annihilation of American hegemony now backed by the world’s largest nuclear stockpile, the world can only hope we aren’t headed directly for Armageddon."
kacap.11.a:0 "DEFCON rises by two levels, further action on standby."

kacap.12.t:0 "[GetNewspaper]Communists win the Second Russian Civil War"
kacap.12.desc:0 "History truly loves to repeat itself. In its continued rejection of national stability Russia has faced yet another civil war, and as if by destiny’s accord, just like before, it leaves it Red. The Krasnyy Front, formed as a coalition between moderate socialists and hardline communists has established complete control over the nation, able to garner the support of the country’s neglected rural regions and the downtrodden populace with the promise of a return to Soviet prosperity and use it to establish a popular movement that would end up crushing the government forces. While on the surface Russia celebrates, fireworks brightening the night sky over Moscow, all is not well within the nation as ideological differences regarding the very nature of the new state threaten to rip the tenuous alliance apart and shatter the nation once more just weeks after its reunification."
kacap.12.a:0 "Will the failures of the Union be avenged?"

kacap.13.t:0 "[GetNewspaper]Kadyrov wins the Second Russian Civil War"
kacap.13.desc:0 "The recent stream of information arriving from Russia continues to baffle political and military experts alike, as after having exceeded their projections at nearly every stage of the war, Ramzan Kadyrov, at last, ascends the Kremlin as the undisputed ruler of Russia. Initially expected merely to use the chaos engulfing the nation to secure an independent Chechen state, the sight of his elite guard routing the untrained draftsmen of Navalny’s territorial defense brigades during nearly every engagement emboldened the leader to subjugate progressively larger swathes of territory under his new caliphate, until once the months of endless fighting at last exhausted the other contenders, the entirety of Russia found itself in Kadyrov’s grip. While today he triumphs, questions remain whether the staunchly Orthodox population accepts their new overlord, or whether he’ll soon be forced to abandon his conquests and return to Chechnya to escape their wrath."
kacap.13.a:0 "Hide your goats and women - the Chechens are here!"

kacap.14.t:0 "[GetNewspaper]The FSB wins the Second Russian Civil War"
kacap.14.desc:0 "For the first time in years, Russia finds itself at peace, the country re-united by an unlikely candidate – Alexey Bortnikov of the FSB. Nominally subservient to the President, the force nevertheless abandoned their oath as a result of Navalny’s abuse of power and took over the Kremlin, forcing the dictator to flee the capital. Expected to swear their allegiance to one of the conflict’s bigger players, the FSB decided to fight for their own glory instead, utilizing the overwhelming resources and production capability of Moscow to progressively subdue the other factions. With the surrender of the last enemy holdouts, Bortnikov declared the prolongation of his emergency powers and foundation of the “Provisional Republic” until he brings stability back to the war-torn country. For now, that day remains far beyond reach, however, as protests still grip Russia’s major cities."
kacap.14.a:0 "Unrest continues, the leaders powerless to stop it"

kacap.15.t:0 "[GetNewspaper]Moscow Surrounded"
kacap.15.desc:0 "As Navalny's anti-corruption regulations package (often called the “Tsarification Package” by the opposition) continues to sweep across the Rosguard's ranks kicking people off their post left and right, breaking news of a rebelling Rosguard brigade storming across Moscow have reached us. \n\nNo-one fully knows what's happening in the city as the course of events is highly chaotic and still unfolding as we speak, but eye witnesses speak of Rosguard taking over the main communication routes in Moscow. Additionally, in the Kitay-Gorod region, an intense exchange of fire was heard between Rosguard forces and local militiamen."
kacap.15.a:0 "Remind them how the August Coup went."

kacap.16.t:0 "[GetNewspaper]Sacred War"
kacap.16.desc:0 "Chechnya’s head TikToker - Ramzan Kadyrov - has recently released a video on his account in which he talks about “swearing off loyalty to the federal government and the beginning of an operation in Dagestan.”, proclaiming a Jihad alongside the Mufti of Chechnya. \n\nIn the early morning hours, videos from CCTV cameras in the city of Khasavyurt in Dagestan have been published online. The footage shows Kadyrov’s men setting off towards Makhachkala, the region’s capital. \n\n\n\nIt seemed like Russia was about to see another August Coup. \n\nLooks like it will see a second civil war instead."
kacap.16.a:0 "The Mother Bear is dead, and her cubs are fighting for her corpse's flesh..."

kacap.17.t:0 "[GetNewspaper]A Red Dawn"
kacap.17.desc:0 "Eye witnesses from the far eastern reaches of the Russian Federation speak of Russian flags being torn from buildings and replaced with flags... of the old Soviet Union. Today at exactly 12:37, in front of the city council, Zyuganov proclaimed the People’s Socialist Republic of the Far East. \n\nWhile most independent international observers have reacted to the proclamation with indifference, expecting a communist government to pop up in Russia, Western governments have shown concern over a potential return of the Soviets, and Vietnam and North Korea have shown support of the proclamation. Local leadership along with Navalny’s “loyalists” evacuated to Khabarovsk, from where they will most likely travel further west. In the meantime the Russian president has appealed to the nation from the besieged city of Moscow, declaring martial law in all of Russia."
kacap.17.a:0 "This is how empires fall: piece by piece."

kacap.18.t:0 "[GetNewspaper]Son of the Immortal Snow-Capped Peaks"
kacap.18.desc:0 "Does another country need to be added to the map of Asia? Early in the morning, Sergei Shoigu - the Minister of National Defense - arrived by plane in Kyzyl with a large part of his staff. In his speech, the General, being Tuvan himself, described that he “needs to ensure the Tuvan’s safety in these trying times.” Witnesses described that along Shoigu and his staff, the 11th Guards Air Assault Brigade had arrived from Ulan-Ude to form the backbone of the Tuvan army. Additionally, cameras at the Sheremetyevo Airport in Moscow have registered General Shoigu’s plane being loaded with large crates. The Russian Federation’s government has thus accused the General of stealing around 30 tonnes of gold reserves from the Central Bank."
kacap.18.a:0 "It's not about the gold, however. It's about the Red Button."

kacap.19.t:0 "[GetNewspaper]Ghost of the Kremlin"
kacap.19.desc:0 "Moscow without a president? Around 3AM Alexei Navalny had disappeared from the Kremlin. The cameras in a nearby hotel had spotted him getting into an unmarked military truck, guarded by soldiers, which then drove unnoticed through the Rosguard’s checkpoints and headed for Petersburg. At 7:42AM, President Navalny spoke in his newest proclamation from a so far unknown location about the need to escape from Moscow, citing threats over an attempt on his life by the FSB as the reason. Additionally, footage of Bortnikov entering the Kremlin alongside a platoon of armed operatives can be found circling around the Internet. \n\nThe Security Forces have officially entered the Russian Civil War."
kacap.19.a:0 "Who will be the next challenger?"

kacap.20.t:0 "[GetNewspaper]Echoes of the Past"
kacap.20.desc:0 "Missing ever since the collapse of Putin’s dictatorship and presumed dead, Dmitry Medvedev has resurfaced in St. Petersburg, taking over the local government. In a fiery address to the nation, the former President declared Navalny’s regime to be illegitimate, calling on all Russian patriots to stand beside him and finally bring the traitor to justice. Having already secured the loyalty of a number of Putin’s old allies, including Viktor Zolotov’s Rosguard and Aleksandr Dugin’s Eurasianist militias, Medvedev’s forces are reported to match those of the loyalists. With the two largest cities in the country having fallen to revolution, Navalny’s government hangs by a thread, the leader scrambling to assemble a response from his new base in Volgograd."
