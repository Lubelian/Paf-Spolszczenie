 unification.29.t:0 "[GetNewspaper]Katowice unify Upper Silesia!" 
 unification.29.desc:0 "The future sometimes happens before the present is ready for it. This was definitely the case with Katowice and the Republic proclaimed there. [KAT.GetLeader] believed that it would be crucial for the capital of Silesia to lead it into the future at all costs, because only in this way will we be able to leave behind the mistakes of the past and build a new society, free from the mistakes of the previous one.\n\nThe election made [KAT.GetRulingParty] the main faction managing the leap into the future. But not everyone is convinced that such a violent and forced change is able to peacefully cause the region of Silesia to choose change voluntarily and surrender to futurization.\nEspecially that some of the slogans proclaimed by the ruling faction sound quite utopian, and Poles - conservative in their nature - are usually not willing to change."

 super.30.desc:0 "There wasn't much hope for Borys to achieve anything. Not while being a lapdog of a greater players in Civic Coalition. But The Fall changed it all. He was left alone, without his party, without guidance. He had to build his own powerbase, but he encoured many problems on his way. And after all, Borys Budka lacked many things.\n\nThat's why he began self-improvement. Literally. Changing flesh into metal, he began to slowly drift away from humanity into something greater. Thus, his goal was clear - ascend all Poles into invincible and immortal beings. Technology was meant to bring another cultural revolution.\n\nBut as much as humans are prone to mistakes, such was fate of Borys's software, which something was glitching. That alone was putting in danger everyone under his rule, and after all - is there any human part left in him at all?"
