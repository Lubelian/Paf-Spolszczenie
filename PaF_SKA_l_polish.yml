POLITICS_EWA_KOPACZ_DESC:0 "One year. One calamitous year. A year her mind would never let her forget. This is how long it took Ewa Kopacz to lose everything. And it was her failure that set the country on its’ dark path. \n\nActive in politics since her late twenties, it seemed that Kopacz was destined for greatness. She found her place in 2001, joining the newly-formed Civic Platform just in time for their first election, winning a seat in her home region of Radom. From there, she continued rising through the ranks, first earning the role of Minister of Health, followed by the vice-chairmanship of her party. The final step on her path to power came in 2014, when following Mr. Tusk’s resignation, she assumed the position of Prime Minister of Poland. Then, it all went horribly wrong. \n\nUnder her leadership, the seemingly unbeatable Civic Platform managed to lose the presidency and both chambers of parliament to PiS within mere months of each other in an electoral season unlike any other. Time would show they would never regain power in the country, as the party she so carelessly dismissed would end up ruling Poland with an iron grip. The failed leader would eventually join her old leader in Brussels, far away from her failure, not knowing whether she’d return to the source of her shame. \n\nJust like many former PO leaders, she was eventually given a chance to join the German invasion. But Kopacz was no traitor. Distancing herself from Tusk, she crossed the porous border, eventually reaching her hometown of Skaryszew, one of the last places in the country that still remembered her fondly. \n\nHoping to finally prove everyone wrong, she established a new state based upon a strong bureaucracy. No longer will disorder cripple the nation. A robust set of laws will surely translate to productivity never before seen in Poland. Yet so far it only meant longer queues for dozens of now-necessary permits. \n\nAnd unless the system finally starts to show some results, Ewa Kopacz’s second shot at ruling the country will last no longer than the first."

unification.109.desc:0 "Amidst the chaos engulfing Poland, one woman’s legacy of failure has been erased. Returning to her hometown was initially a somber experience for Ewa Kopacz, as she took on the task of building a new state in Skaryszew. Based on a strong bureaucratic tradition, work was reorganized according to a set of central directives, and all aspects of society standardized. In a surprising turn of events, this plan brought newfound prosperity to the area, allowing Kopacz to spread her influence throughout the region. Now firmly in charge, the chairwoman spends her days writing new laws together with a hand-selected group of experts. With each passing day, more aspects of life are being regulated, new permits issued and rules enforced. Despite existing dissent, the bureaucracy continues to grow, further entrenching itself in the lives of the people of Radom. Perhaps one day this new order will bind all of Poland."

unificationreg.109.desc:0 "The lawless remnants of Ziobro’s domain have been brought under orderly bureaucratic control, with the citizens of the Holy Cross voivodeship abruptly waking up to a new reality – one where affairs previously settled by arguments of strength are now resolved through a legalistic justice system regulating every aspect of daily life. Despite hasty programs meant to familiarize the people with the thousands of new laws they now find themselves subject to, a massive administrative gridlock has paralyzed the region ever since its incorporation, with years of faulty record-keeping making it near-impossible both for private individuals and established companies to successfully apply for the permits required for their continued operation. With most transactions forced into the black market, the expansion has thus far served as a bitter pill for Skaryszew’s pencil pushers. Nevertheless, the system presses on undeterred, churning out new legislation with each legislative session."

unificationsupreg.109.desc:0 "Despite fierce local resistance, the entirety of Galicia has been incorporated into Skaryszew’s growing bureaucracy. The free spirit of Bieszczady has been forcefully tamed, with even the most serene of Poland’s regions now bound by the increasingly byzantine network of laws and codes. A specially trained administrative cadre has been dispatched to the conquered voivodeships to ensure the enforcement of the ever-growing mountain of ordinance, as a wave of objections threatens to cripple the progressive curtailing of unregulated activity. Among the victors, no celebrations ensued, because the addition of yet more territory necessitates the creation of an unprecedented amount of new legislation regarding its governance and development. It appears, against all odds that this republic of overworked clerks stands poised to challenge the remaining warlords in a bid for national reunification. Perhaps, with its army greatly benefitting from the extreme standardization, Kopacz’s domain might yet manage to encompass the entire nation."

super.109.desc:0 "Among chaos and anarchy, order has at last reigned, as for the first time in nearly a decade Poland finds itself whole. Through countless victories and immense effort, Ewa Kopacz has earned herself a second chance at ruling the wounded nation. With the threat of PiS no longer there to sabotage and burn her plans, the new Madam President is at last free to implement her vision of an empowered bureaucracy. All across the nation, sweeping reforms bring regulation to even the most minute activities, yet underneath the administrators’ cheers, many citizens find themselves stuck in application processes for permits and licenses, spending their days going from office to office in a Kafkaesque web of legislation so tangled, even the most seasoned officials fail to make sense of all the contradictory stipulations. For all its might, the bureaucratic machine of Skaryszew has only one mode – drafting more and more laws until it collapses under its weight at last."
