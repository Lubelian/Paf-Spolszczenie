POLITICS_EWA_KOPACZ_DESC:0 "One year. One calamitous year. A year her mind would never let her forget. This is how long it took Ewa Kopacz to lose everything. And it was her failure that set the country on its’ dark path. \n\nActive in politics since her late twenties, it seemed that Kopacz was destined for greatness. She found her place in 2001, joining the newly-formed Civic Platform just in time for their first election, winning a seat in her home region of Radom. From there, she continued rising through the ranks, first earning the role of Minister of Health, followed by the vice-chairmanship of her party. The final step on her path to power came in 2014, when following Mr. Tusk’s resignation, she assumed the position of Prime Minister of Poland. Then, it all went horribly wrong. \n\nUnder her leadership, the seemingly unbeatable Civic Platform managed to lose the presidency and both chambers of parliament to PiS within mere months of each other in an electoral season unlike any other. Time would show they would never regain power in the country, as the party she so carelessly dismissed would end up ruling Poland with an iron grip. The failed leader would eventually join her old leader in Brussels, far away from her failure, not knowing whether she’d return to the source of her shame. \n\nJust like many former PO leaders, she was eventually given a chance to join the German invasion. But Kopacz was no traitor. Distancing herself from Tusk, she crossed the porous border, eventually reaching her hometown of Skaryszew, one of the last places in the country that still remembered her fondly. \n\nHoping to finally prove everyone wrong, she established a new state based upon a strong bureaucracy. No longer will disorder cripple the nation. A robust set of laws will surely translate to productivity never before seen in Poland. Yet so far it only meant longer queues for dozens of now-necessary permits. \n\nAnd unless the system finally starts to show some results, Ewa Kopacz’s second shot at ruling the country will last no longer than the first."

unification.109.desc:0 "Amidst the chaos engulfing Poland, one woman’s legacy of failure has been erased. Returning to her hometown was initially a somber experience for Ewa Kopacz, as she took on the task of building a new state in Skaryszew. Based on a strong beaurocratic tradition, work was reorganized according to a set of central directives and all aspects of society standardized. In a surprising turn of events, this plan has brought newfound prosperity to the area, allowing Kopacz to spread her influence throughout the region. Now firmly in charge, the chairwoman spends her days writing new laws together with a hand-selected group of experts. With each passing day more aspects of life are being regulated, new permits issued and rules enforced. Despite existing dissent, the beaurocracy continues to grow, further entrenching itself in the lives of the people of Radom. Perhaps one day this new order will bind all of Poland."
