unification.120.t:0 "[GetNewspaper]The Warsaw Underground State unifies Capital District!"
unification.120.desc:0 "The citizens of the capital carefully exit their hideouts, gunshots no longer resonating around Warsaw. Smoke emerges from the damaged skyscrapers and much of the city lies in total ruin, yet a certain sense of optimism persists nonetheless. Twice thwarted by PiS, left with nearly nothing despite his many years of service, and once hanging by a thread onto single streets and corners, Rafa≈Ç Trzaskowski is back in control of Warsaw once more. Under his rule, the metropolis slowly returns to life, re-emerging from the rubble as an economic behemoth, like the phoenix from the ashes. Warlords now eye the city greedily, intent on grabbing a piece of this newfound prosperity for themselves. The capital remains under constant threat and it may never grow complacent, lest all this work will come undone, but with years of experience governing the unruly city, who better than Trzaskowski to guide it through these trying times?"

unificationsupreg.120.desc:0 "Post-Fall Poland is a home for all kinds of political and religious movements. All of them contradict the natural human need for freedom and prosperity offered by Warsaw ruled by President Trzaskowski. \n After the liberation of Warsaw, the legal Polish government of President Trzaskowski has come a long way, rebuilding the economic, cultural and scientific potential of Warsaw. The potential that was used to liberate the rest of the Mazowieckie Voivodeship from the rule of bandits, oligarchs, warlords, sectarians, fascists and other evil people who reject democracy, the Constitution and the human rights. \n The Mazowieckie Voivodeship is already liberated, but a lot of work is still needed to restore constitutional order in it and extend it to the rest of the country. The civil war is coming to an end, and democracy seems to be winning"
