unification.90.desc:0 "Shock. Anger. Confusion. Those are the words of the residents of Pomerelia when asked about their feelings towards their new regime. What happened over the past few months was a shock to everybody. Everybody except Krzysztof Jackowski, who claims to have predicted his own rise to power in the region many years ago. From the sleepy towns of Człuchów and Chojnice warriors marched out, quickly reaching the sea as one by one warlords turned to ash before them. And with the capture of Gdańsk, the prophecy is finally complete. Every enemy crushed and each uprising quelled have only added to the mystique of the region’s new leader as surely only someone with truly supernatural abilities would be able to keep winning despite seemingly insurmountable odds. Only one man knows what happens next. And his lips remain sealed for now."
