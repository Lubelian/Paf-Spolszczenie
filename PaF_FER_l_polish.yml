POLITICS_PETER_LANGER_DESC:0 "Born to a proud Silesian-German family, ever since his youngest days, Peter Langer watched on helplessly as first, the communists suppressed, and then the democrats ignored his culture. He saw his language dying around him, his friends, neighbors, even family members embracing the ways of their Polish masters. Unwilling to simply allow the dream of a free Silesia to perish for good under the uncaring watch of Warsaw, Langer founded the Ślonsko Ferajna as a means to fight for his identity’s survival. Months turned to years since then, however, and years to decades, as initial hopes gave way to resentment. No matter the number of marches, publicity stunts, and calls for independence, the popular support never seemed to materialize beyond a fringe group of true believers. While most would have abandoned the struggle in the face of continuous failure, Langer refused to yield, realizing that there simply exists no peaceful solution to the Polish issue.  \n\nReforming the Ferajna into a true militia, organized in accordance with old German formations from the great wars, Langer began to wreak havoc upon the Polish population in a terror campaign aiming to destroy the instruments of their control. Fully expected to be swiftly put down by the local authorities, in a fortunate turn of events for the Silesian guerillas, before the central government could muster a coherent response, it found itself having to send nearly all available manpower and materiel to the western border in an attempt to halt the German invasion.  \n\nWith nobody left to oppose them, the Ferajna managed to carve out a chunk of the lands for themselves around the town of Tarnowskie Góry. In Poland’s following collapse, Silesian statelets began forming in the region’s major cities for the first time in half a millennium. For now, they remain allied in their common goal of preserving their shared culture, however, Langer can’t help but look at most of them in disgust – some would have no qualms rejoining their oppressors, some aren’t even led by a pure-blooded Hanys. The peace between the statelets grows ever more tenuous by the day, as the Ferajna prepares to cleanse Silesia once and for all."

unification.27.desc:0 "Not all those who call themselves Silesians think of Poles as the same nation. There are also those who regard Poland as an oppressive occupier who has eradicated the Silesian language and culture for years. The most radical voices found an outlet in the Ślunska Ferajna faction (which could be translated as the Silesian Association).\n\nThe division into hanys (Silesians) and gorols (non-Silesians) became for them an obsessive border of division of society. And in a truly Silesian state, there was no place for racially impure people. Although it has nothing to do with race, displacements and even murders are now happening in the Silesian metropolis, while militias go from house to house measuring the level of Silesianness in every citizen who remained in the territory of Upper Silesia. We can only be afraid of one thing - this level may turn out to be too low for too many inhabitants."
