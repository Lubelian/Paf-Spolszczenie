unification.77.t:0 "[GetNewspaper]The United States of Polonia unite West Pomerania!"
unification.77.desc:0 "After many years spent estranged from his homeland, Max Kolonko returns with guns blazing to bring his revolution to Poland. Armed to the teeth with American weaponry and boasting a large army of loyal patriots, the controversial journalist’s campaign has proven to be more than just mere folly. Landing on the shores of Western Pomerania in the wake of the Eurokommissariats’ collapse, he found nothing but constant warfare against both German and Polish forces alike. At last, with nobody left to oppose him within the state, he stands victorious, able to shape the region to his will. While the leader’s promise of a Poland of the people, for the people, may sound enticing to many, questions still persist regarding Kolonko’s mental fitness and whether his ego may yet prove to be his undoing, as contrary to his movement’s beliefs he is yet to relinquish many of his powers, instead fomenting a cult of personality around himself."
