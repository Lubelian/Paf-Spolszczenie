unification.78.desc:0 "The Fall of Poland paved the way for all kinds of organizations, allowing many a unique chance at breaching the barrier towards statehood. And yet, out of hundreds of options, Lower Silesia has fallen under the control of one the least viable and most reviled of them all – the Wrocław MPK, once responsible for the daily tears and cusses of thousands of commuters, now finds itself in charge of the entire voivodeship. Initially instituted only to maintain the city’s crumbling infrastructure, Balawejder’s regime nevertheless managed to supplant its civilian government, eventually utilizing Wrocław’s resources to conquer the entirety of the region. For now, the Clique aims to remain true to its original purpose, without any intent to claim their neighbors’ lands, especially as its powerbase remains confined to borders of the voivodeship’s capital. Only time will tell whether MPK’s rule can extend beyond them."

unificationreg.78.desc:0 "It seems that the Wrocław Tram Clique has expanded, as the company’s ascent to ruling over Lower Silesia has led to its metamorphosis, as well as its diversification into every form of rail transportation. Though their enemies displayed superior organization and fighting spirit, Balawejder’s regime managed to prevail through the utilization of an ingenious network of tram-based logistics. Having gained control over vast swathes of highly developed land, the Clique stands poised to stake a claim for the country’s rulership, especially since its rebranding into the Silesian Railway Company, which suggests expansionist ambitions towards the east. And yet, instead, the MPK focuses its newfound resources not on any form of intricate statecraft, but on simply getting its trams to finally run on time... and stop derailing – a task seemingly impossible despite half of the voivodeship’s funds dedicated towards it."

unificationsupreg.78.desc:0 "Rather than legitimate governments, radicals, or even bandits, a mere company has come to rule a quarter of what once was Poland, shackled with the monumental task of rebuilding it from ruin... or at least fixing the region’s crumbling infrastructure, as the lives of ordinary citizens have thus far largely been left alone. After all, people will find a way to survive one way or another, it’s the greater projects that require immediate funding, such as constructing a tram network in every town and expanding the system of rail-based logistics. Though access to petrol remains a difficulty, Balawejder’s visionary plans to create Europe’s first rail-oriented economy have caused nationwide buzz, with experts vigorously discussing the idea’s viability. Yet still, concerns over the Clique’s ability to provide reliable service continue, as, despite grand visions, the trams of Wrocław remain as broken as ever. And how can a state claim any degree of competence if it can’t even succeed in its core mission?"

super.78.t:0 "[GetNewspaper]A nation on rails"
super.78.desc:0 "In a remarkable display of vision, ingenuity, and sheer infrastructural and logistical dominance, MPK Wrocław, a struggling tram company, emerged as the driving force behind Poland’s reunification. Now in control of the country, the government continues its focus on completing the transition from asphalt-, to rail-based transportation and economy, aided by the construction of the world’s most comprehensive transit network. In the re-emergent nation, trams have become a symbol of progress and connectedness, linking together the once-disconnected cities, towns, and, most importantly, people. Still, the Clique has drawn criticism for its suppression of democracy on both the local and national levels, with the unelected corporate hierarchy presiding over all administrative decisions. Yet, Balawejder, just like his former Italian counterpart, remains determined that elections remain a secondary issue to getting the trains to run on time – something the MPK still hasn’t been able to achieve."
