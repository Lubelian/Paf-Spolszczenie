 ##Characters##
POLITICS_WLODZIMIERZ_CZARZASTY_DESC: "These were not good years for the left-wing parties. The growth of Law and Justice's power has significantly limited the possibilities of an effective democratic campaign, mainly due to a series of persecutions against left-wing politicians and their electorate. The relentless obstruction of life by law enforcement became one of the many reasons why the Left finally snapped. Radicalized groups of socialist militias began to form throughout the country, ranging from the vandalization of monuments to attempt the bomb attack on Nowogrodzka Street. During the days before The Fall, Włodzimierz Czarzasty managed to escape the capital but found himself in an uncomfortable position as persona non grata. The EU intervention and the total disintegration of the Polish government did not surprise Czarzasty, but the nightmare that followed was not comparable to the most pessimistic scenarios. Czarzasty quickly organized a substitute administration in Sosnowiec and proclaimed the Republic of Zagłębie. The provisional apparatus of power stretched across the entire Dąbrowa Basin, from Czeladź to Dąbrowa Górnicza and Jaworzno. The left-wing Polish Committee of National Liberation, which was established, had several problems. In his search for allies who would support Czarzasty's dreams of maintaining power, he turned to the two largest factions in Zagłębie: communists from Dąbrowa Górnicza and anti-fascists from Jaworzno, creating a alliance of Międzypowiatówka. It is not hard to guess that the cracks in the common front of the left began to appear almost immediately, which resulted in these two factions being granted great autonomy. Now it is only up to Włodzimierz Czarzasty whether Międzypowiatówka will survive as one or another civil war will break out, drowning the region in blood once again."

unification.15.desc: "Włodzimierz Czarzasty did not expect to be the chairman of the whole country ever again. And in part he was right, because what he had to manage is only a shadow and a distant echo of statehood. However, he chose a very good place to spread his ideas. Red Zagłębie has very long left-wing traditions, which made it very easy to convince people to Czarzasty's ideas.\n\nAt the same time, he led an alliance of several quasi-communist states, which were called the Interpoviats. Although the alliance collapsed, Czarzasty remained victorious with his militias.\n\nThe President of the new republic now faces an important task - to play all his neighbors strategically. Because each of them will wait for the other to stumble. The Cold War begins, as everyone hopes that he will be able to unite all of Poland. In Czarzasty it is more than hope. It's self-confidence."

 super.39.desc: "Fall of socialist state in 1989 was only a temporary solution for four decades. But failure of capitalism and threat of an authoritarian state showed many, that the flame of revolution can never be truly extinguished.\n\nLocating his government in one of the most prominent seats of socialism in Poland, Włodzimierz Czarzasty wasn't at first sure about the way he was supposed to take to bring Poland back to life. If only he could resurrect what was best in marxist-leninist theories, and not fail like the communist states before him...\n\nBut they weren't true communists. Not really. It's Lenin after all, who was right. Together with our loyal red banners we shall liberate every man, woman and non-binary gender on this planet from their own demise."

But failure of capitalism and threat of an authoritarian state showed many, that the flame of revolution can never be truly extinguished.\n\nDeclared a Prime Minister of Republic of Zagłębie, Włodzimierz Czarzasty was still true to ideals of a socialism, and so he continued to bring back many forgotten relicts of the bygone era, as well as mixing it with modern society.\n\nAs for now, the red flags are flying all over Polish territory, and while Polish national spirit wasn't thrown away, instead it was embraced as the foundation of a better society. Czarzasty now promises a bright future and restoration of a true European Union, instead of this neoliberal German behemoth that it became."
