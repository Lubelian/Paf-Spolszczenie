unification.138.t:0 "[GetNewspaper]Wadowicka Republika Ludowa jednoczy Małopolskę!"
unification.138.desc:0 "The shattered lands of Małopolskie have at last been unified by a single force, yet unexpectedly it would emerge not from one of the dominant urban centers, but rather from the comparatively quiet town of Wadowice. In a grand act of cosmic irony, the late Pope John Paul II’s birthplace would serve as the base of operations for a state completely antithetical to his teachings under Michał Nowicki’s communist vanguard. Built upon nostalgia for the Polish People’s Republic and strict adherence to Stalinist ideology, the proletarian government finds itself at odds with the beliefs of the common man. Insider reports indicate a heavy authoritarian tendency within the army, with any signs of dissent labeled as foreign agitation and heavily punished. After all, as per the Chairman’s words, no sane person would stand against the coming Red Rebirth."

unificationreg.138.t:0 "[GetNewspaper]Rewolucja maszeruje dalej"
unificationreg.138.desc:0 "The torch of proletarian liberation burns ever brighter, as despite fierce resistance from the entrenched bourgeoisie, Poland’s southern heartlands have been overcome by a red revolution. Standing strong in the face of enemies both within and without, the People’s Vanguard has expanded its control to encompass all of Small Galicia. With the combined industrial might of Kraków and Zagłębie, the Chairman sets his sight towards the northeast, as beyond his state’s borders the impoverished peasants yearn for freedom under the rule of tyrants. At least such is the army’s official position, as those in already conquered territory tremble in fear of increasing political repression, with anyone discovered to have served the fallen warlords brandished as a class traitor. As more and more citizens take the one-way trip to the Killing Fields for increasingly tenuous connections to the old regimes, those who remain are left to wander – will they be next?"

unificationsupreg.138.t:0 "[GetNewspaper]The flames of revolution over Galicia"
unificationsupreg.138.desc:0 "The status quo within Poland hangs by a thread, as for the third time in a hundred years, a communist force stands at the gates of Warsaw, and just like its predecessors, the goals of the People’s Liberation Army are clear – the total abolition of bourgeois rule within the nation. Internally, this aim has largely been achieved, with landowners stripped of their possessions and the industry communalized. For those who oppose the system, a network of prisons and work camps awaits, where dissidents are forcefully re-educated... if they manage to survive the grueling conditions, that is. As the people learn to fear and revere him, a cult of personality grows around Nowicki, with the Father of the Revolution modeling his image after his Soviet mentor. Perhaps if the Red Army manages to reach the sea, the Chairman’s name will one day be spoken alongside that of the General Secretary."

super.138.t:0 "[GetNewspaper]Czerwony świt nad Polską"
super.138.desc:0 "Believed to be forever dead, the People’s Republic of Poland has returned, this time not imposed by foreign conquest, but as an organic proletarian movement. Despite this, the Stalinist spirit lives strong within the new nation, as a similarly despotic system has been imposed upon the people. As per the infallible theory, the social structure has been fully upended and class differences abolished, with all men and women working for the advancement of common folk. Having reached the border on all sides, the republic turns inwards to lick its wounds and eliminate all remaining opposition, both real and perceived, as lists of supposed traitors grow with each day. Still, the rhetoric of Chairman Nowicki is clear – the revolution won’t be complete until the world is fully rid of capitalist influence. The forces of the Union stand on high alert, as the Red Tide that swept Poland threatens to wash over Europe."
super.138.a:0 "Tym razem nie będzie cudu nad Wisłą"
