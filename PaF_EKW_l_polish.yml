POLITICS_DONALD_TUSK_DESC:0 "What was it all for? Dla Polski? Surely he hadn’t made things here better. Für Deutschland? All he did was tie ball and chain to its legs. Pour l’Europe? Isn’t its unity a mockery now? \n\nDonald Tusk would think himself as a descendant of Charlemagne and Napoleon – a humble one, but a descendant nonetheless. His impulse to strive to become the helmsman of European unity were his mixed Kashubian-Polish-German orgins, his obstacle – Poland. Grounded in country with one foot outside of Europe, he tried all his life to place them both firmly on the grounds of liberty, democracy and tolerance – first as an liberal oppositionist, then as the Civic Platform leader, a prime minister, a President of the European Council, finally as the providential man of anti-PiS opposition. Only when the crisis loomed large, he found his weapon, liberalism, rusty and in need of reforging. But it was too late. He failed. \n\nTusk was considered by Brussels and Berlin to be an ideal leader for Poland brought forcefully to European fold. At home among strangers, he became a stranger among his own. A Wallenrod at best, a Judas and Antichrist at worst, he can’t count on any support from the indigenous population. His authority stems from German tanks’ barrels, and thus he finally became the man he was potrayed by PiS: a marionette enforcer of the Eurofascist despotism. \n\nAll is not lost however. Despite all and everything, Tusk is still Polish – even if no one, including himself, would like him to be. He has been tied for life to this abnormal land. Time will tell if his ambitions will suffice to transform it."

super.5.t:0 "[GetNewspaper]End of the Eurokommissariats"
super.5.desc:0 "The 'EK Leaks' and the resulting controversy in all of the EU have resulted in a complete downfall of the Eurokommissariats' structure. Schlesien was the first to fall, with fragments of the disorganized German forces in Silesia encircled by rebelling Polish factions, which now begin cementing their rule over the lands that used to be controlled by the Bundeswehr, but now Westpolen has begun disintegrating as well, as various warlords called their loyalists to arms against the EU, roads are being taken over by bandits, European units fall back to regroup on the German-Polish border (so that they can avoid getting swarmed from all sides like how their southern comrades did and German settlers form militias to protect their new homes and properties from 'Polish backwards schweinhunds'. Despite the danger of complete military breakdown, Poles rejoice left and right, as they've finally got a chance to forge a new state of their dreams, free from the hegemonies of Europe and PiS."

unification.54.desc:0 "Order reigns once again in West Pomerania. EKW authorities, led by the discredited former opposition leader Donald Tusk, have proclaimed they are once again in full control of the region. Few believed that the rump state would be able to hold its ground in face of overwhelming Polish resistance and abandonment by most European forces, let alone regain lost territories. The rightful masters have, however, prevailed in battle and now they once again stand tall over their Polish subjects. \n\nCareful observers have noticed that the Eurokomissariat, having done most of the fighting with its own amalgamation of Polish-European forces, has gained significant independence during their campaign. Now Tusk is, in fact, the sole ruler of this piece of Poland, a fact that scares many Poles and many Europeans as well to the bone. It is very likely that Tusk's ambitions, having been emboldened even more, will drag his domain into a new Drang nach Osten."
