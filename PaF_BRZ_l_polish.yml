BRZ_legacy_of_pzpn: "Legacy of PZPN"
BRZ_legacy_of_pzpn_desc: "There has been no organization as damaging to football within our nation, and Jerzy Brzęczek’s career for that matter, as the Polish Football Association (PZPN). This corrupt clique of the sport’s dinosaurs has influenced every facet of the beautiful game, leaving a whole generation of players and coaches to rot under the ideas of the “Polish Training Thought”. Nearly our entire pool of talent has been brought up under this system, stifling any form of creativity and technical skill. Unless we dip into uncharted waters and fully reform our approach to football, we are bound to forever remain in mediocrity."
BRZ_nothings_wrong_poles: "Nothing's Wrong, Poles"
BRZ_nothings_wrong_poles_desc: "Years of defeat and disappointment have created a unique mentality within the average Polish football fan. While a typical Janusz loves to complain, he will stick by the team no matter what, turning out in full force for every match, usually sat on a couch in front of his aging TV with a beer in his hand. Ever the conformist, we can expect little to no meaningful resistance to our plans from the majority of the population, even if the times truly get desperate."
BRZ_bandit_hooligans: "Ultras on the Streets"
BRZ_bandit_hooligans_desc: "You can never truly feel safe wandering the streets of ZWKT-controlled cities, as raving bands of Ultras representing each of the teams active in our territory regularly harass the populace, approaching selected citizens, demanding they state their club affiliation, and beating or robbing them upon hearing a wrong answer. And when they’re not busy terrifying the people, they fight amongst themselves, leaving us to deal with any collateral damage. With each day that we fail to find a permanent solution to their violence, our towns burn with the fire of a thousand flares."

BRZ_klobuck_training_centre_desc: "Every training session we hold at the current facilities of Olimpia Truskolasy painfully exposes the shortcomings of the crumbling stadium. Each goal-bound shot stopped by the muddy pitch, or twisted ankle from tripping on uneven grass makes a mockery of our claims of professionalism. The only way to move forward is the creation of an entirely new training centre – one even the most pretentious members of the old national team couldn’t scoff at. We will turn Kłobuck from a sleepy town on the periphery of Jura into the most respected and renowned sporting facility in the country, equipped with everything our players could possibly need. No longer will we have to desperately seek out anyone with even a crumb of talent. We’ll make sure any self-respecting footballer knows the only way to meaningfully develop his skills is to flock to our ranks."

BRZ_nsfl_inauguration_cup_desc: "As preparations for the league’s launch continue, what better way to generate buzz for the upcoming competition, as well as give our players some much-needed match sharpness than a tournament consisting of some of the region’s best teams? The cup will be a celebration of football’s rebirth within the region, so let’s make sure that when locals put their dusty scarves and jerseys back on after years of disuse, we give them a showing that’ll make them begging for more. And whilst the result may be only secondary to the greater significance of the occasion, obviously, the boost from winning some silverware wouldn’t hurt either."

We could kill two birds with one stone and get the Ultras off our streets, unleashing their fury on our enemies. While most recruits quiver in their boots at the mere mention of frontline action, these fanatics will seek out combat on their own, forming some of the most ruthless and brutal units this region has ever seen. All it would take is giving the hooligans a share of the spoils and free reign to deal with our foes as they please. Surely it won’t hurt us too much to turn a blind eye to their conduct from time to time."

BRZ_every_school_a_club_desc: "While it may sound tempting to direct the majority of our funds into quenching our need for immediate reinforcements, we must by no means neglect the youngest generation. The sad fact is that despite the country being home to thousands of footballers, most of them are virtually useless, having the technique of a plank of wood. And there are only so many tricks those old dogs can learn. Given that our schools are already unable to perform most of their duties due to material shortages, why not give the children another choice? We shall build an Orlik next to every school and enforce mandatory training for our youngest players. With just enough focus and the right coaches, we will foster a new generation with football firmly in their blood that will finally surpass Górski’s Eagles. "

As a result, you’d be hard-pressed to find a solitary road with more than a single lane connecting our towns. While this has been enough for the backward life previously enjoyed by our citizens, it’s hardly befitting of the grandest up-and-coming footballing centre on Polish soil. Now that we finally have the means to develop our lands, we shall remedy this situation and build a truly modern infrastructural foundation, funneling all young players with a dream of a better life right into Truskolasy"

 ##Characters##
POLITICS_JERZY_BRZECZEK_DESC: "Jerzy Brzęczek did not have an easy life and not just because of the collapse of the country. The latter he accepted with the hope that it would wipe clean the stain on his honor. Even so, his name was still a symbol of mediocrity in Poland. However, the Truskolasy, where he had arrived after the Fall, severely regretted this carelessness. With the help of the militias of the teams that came with him, he overthrew the remnants of the former administration, and appointed the ZWKT with himself as the Supreme Coach. \nNow, people form clubs where they eat, drink, work and exercise to develop their football skills. In Brzęczek's state, there is no room for lollygagging and the two biggest crimes of thought - Peszkism (hedonism and alcoholism) and Nawalkism (corruption, lies, lack of ideology and shallowness), and any mentions of former football coaches were erased from the books, together with those who destroyed Polish football the most - The dreaded Portuguese... \nEveryone else were descripted as spirit-lacking lackeys of Polish Association, which in fact was to blame for everything wrong that happened to Brzęczek's life. \n\nBut that shall change, and the Supreme Coach will carry us to victory with his iron hand! \n\nBrothers and Sisters, march to the field! Each of us is a representative from now on!"
