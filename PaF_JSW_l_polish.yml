unification.23.t:0 "[GetNewspaper]Jastrzębie-Zdrój unifies Upper Silesia!"
unification.23.desc:0 "The black gold of the Polish land forever defined the image of the Silesian region. Rapid industrialization led to the creation of such behemoths as the Jastrzębian Coal Company, and few could expect that in 2027 it is the coal corporation that will decide the fate of Upper Silesia. With the heavy influence of trade unions, miners are following a traditionalist path that puts coal on the pedestal of the population's priorities.\n\nSurely Silesia will not freeze to death, but will it be able to convince the rest of Poland that mining is not dead yet? [JSW.GetLeader] is determined to lead Poland to the next industrial revolution, which will permanently seal our country's position as a key industrial player in Europe. But how long will coal continue to fuel the region's economy?"
unification.23.a:0 "Not all the coal that is dug warms the world!"
