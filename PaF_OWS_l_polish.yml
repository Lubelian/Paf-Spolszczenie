unification.84.desc:0 "Of all the contenders vying for control of Pomerelia, perhaps none was as unlikely to win as Jerzy Owsiak. However, it seems that popularity can truly get you far, as the leader’s long history of charitable work and a relatively clean record, further helped by the decision not to cooperate with the occupation authorities proved to be the recipe for success. Formed primarily as a populist front and refuge for the politically disaffected, the state of the Grand Orchestra represents a continuation of Owsiak’s work. A loose organization lacking many proper institutions of governance, a monumental challenge lies ahead to establish itself as a respectable state able to provide for its citizens and not merely a stopgap for a more powerful warlord on their path of conquest. The people of Pomerelia can only hope for their success or else the rights they now enjoy may forever disappear."

unificationreg.84.desc:0 "Jerzy Owsiak has done it again. Under his banner and under the heart-shaped sticker, the people of Pomerelia marched on the lands of their western neighbor, and motivated by the great struggle, pressed on undeterred until the rival government surrendered. In the ruins of Szczecin, Owsiak proclaimed his victory, yet stressed that the Orchestra must go on until all of Poland is fully unified, and while the jubilant soldiers cheered to the sound of the music, everyone knew their task is far from complete. Even though the Grand Orchestra has at last established itself as a legitimate state, the question remains as to its direction. After all, an organization aiming to represent everyone will eventually struggle to keep them united behind a meaningful goal, especially as the flaws of its populism become more evident. Will Owsiak manage to continue his momentum, or is the Orchestra doomed to collapse without a purpose?"

unificationsupreg.84.desc:0 "Like an unstoppable tide, the population centers of Greater Poland and Kuyavia fell, all to the Orchestra’s unending march. As the cities found themselves occupied, money was redistributed and given to those in need. Soldiers and militias donning the heart-shaped sticker patrol the conquered regions, however, their presence is not to incite violence, but instead protect the destitute. At least such is the official story, as this image hides an awful truth. In order to keep the organization united, Owsiak turned to purging anyone who disagreed with his vision for the future of Poland. Behind a veneer of the locals’ cheers, unbeknownst to the docile majority, the opposition finds itself sentenced and silenced. Still, the people cling to Owsiak with utmost loyalty, after all, who would turn against the man who provides for and protects them?"

super.84.desc:0 "The sound of music fills Poland, as following the conclusion of their latest campaign, artists of all kinds perform in the nation’s major cities in honor of Jerzy Owsiak – the leader of the Grand Orchestra and Poland’s unlikely unifier. None could have predicted the events of the past few years, after all, even his most loyal supporters doubted the Orchestrator’s state would last longer than a couple of weeks, much less expand to encompass the entire country. Few, too, could have foreseen the measures he would take to keep it all intact, but in the end, how does this repression differ from others, dedicated to reaching their goals by any means necessary? The world watches on, wondering what stance the regime shall take in regional and global affairs, however, one thing is certain: the Orchestra shall play until the end of the World and then one day longer."
super.84.a:0 "Za Polskę! Za Owsiaka! Za Orkiestrę!"
