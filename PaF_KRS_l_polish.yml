 ##Ideas##
 
 KRS_corrupt_hospitals: "Corrupt Hospitals"
 KRS_corrupt_hospitals_desc: "An ominous reputation surrounds the Consortium’s hospitals, as very few of those who enter the facilities ever manage to leave them alive – a percentage so low in fact, even the poor sanitary conditions and lack of medicine in post-fall Poland do little to explain it. Those that do return home speak of horrors ripped straight out of nightmares and cruel, involuntary experiments, a concern handwaved by the authorities as merely a “temporary mental deterioration following the disease”. However, curiously, all the patients’ stories do seem to match..."
 KRS_lack_of_legitimacy: "Lack of Legitimacy"
 KRS_lack_of_legitimacy_desc: "No government, no matter how despotic, can survive without some form of legitimacy, and while everything else can be bought in these lawless lands, this bedrock of a functional state is sadly not for sale. Without it, we cannot rely on any outside support, as even other warlord statelets refuse to acknowledge our existence. Why would they? After all, in their eyes we stand for nothing, just a pitiful personification of greed, a symbol of the rot within Poland." 
 KRS_wave_of_kidnappings: "Wave of Kidnappings"
 KRS_wave_of_kidnappings_desc: "In the dark of night, white vans spread terror on the streets of Consortium’s towns, kidnapping the unfortunate few who couldn’t find the safety of their homes in time. Friends, spouses, children... nobody is safe from the ominous men in black masks. Where they’re taken remains unknown, if they’re even taken anywhere at all. The only sure thing is that those who disappear into the vans §Rnever return.§!"
 KRS_wave_of_kidnappings_2: "Wave of Kidnappings"
 KRS_wave_of_kidnappings_2_desc: "In the dark of night, white vans spread terror on the streets of Consortium’s towns, kidnapping the unfortunate few who couldn’t find the safety of their homes in time. Friends, spouses, children... nobody is safe from the ominous men in black masks. Where they’re taken remains unknown, if they’re even taken anywhere at all. The only sure thing is that those who disappear into the vans §Rnever return.§!"
 KRS_wave_of_kidnappings_3: "Wave of Kidnappings"
 KRS_wave_of_kidnappings_3_desc: "In the dark of night, white vans spread terror on the streets of Consortium’s towns, kidnapping the unfortunate few who couldn’t find the safety of their homes in time. Friends, spouses, children... nobody is safe from the ominous men in black masks. Where they’re taken remains unknown, if they’re even taken anywhere at all. The only sure thing is that those who disappear into the vans §Rnever return.§!" 
 KRS_armed_banditry: "Armed Banditry"
 KRS_armed_banditry_desc: "Our borders have always been seen as easy targets by the bandits and pillagers from Gniezno and Skierniewice, as well as marauding Calisian auxiliaries, all intent on depriving us of our hard-earned resources. While we may have been able to stretch out our manpower just enough to keep them at bay, recently we have been getting increasingly pushed back by a new threat, right in Kutno and Krośniewice - one that is merciless, deadly, effective, and most importantly impossible to track down."
 KRS_bandits_bought_out: "Bandits Bought Out"
 KRS_bandits_bought_out_desc: "If we can't beat them, we can buy their loyalty instead. The hardened criminals of our underworld know the ways of war better than our soldiers, having spent their whole lives in one conflict or another. Perhaps they could even teach our mercenaries a thing or two."
 KRS_bandits_in_work_camps: "Bandits in Work Camps"
 KRS_bandits_in_work_camps_desc: "As we finally round up the bandits that have been ravaging our lands, we can make them pay for the destruction they have brought. In work camps, they will toil all day and night until they have earned back every penny they’ve stolen from the Consortium."
 KRS_j22_compound: "J-22 Compound"
 KRS_j22_compound_desc: "A revolutionary, state-of-the-art research facility dedicated to developing a brand-new generation of chemical weapons for strategic deployment against the Consortium’s enemies. Who cares if using them is considered a war crime?"
 KRS_boneless: "The Boneless"
 KRS_boneless_desc: "Deformed remains of the bandits formerly plaguing the Consortium's territory, now turned into an army of misshapen, brainless creatures made purely of muscle and flesh. At our command these abominations will charge at our enemies, bringing true terror into their eyes. No thoughts. No pain. Not even the heaviest gunfire will stop these monsters."
 KRS_boneless_2: "The Boneless"
 KRS_boneless_2_desc: "Deformed remains of the bandits formerly plaguing the Consortium's territory, now turned into an army of misshapen, brainless creatures made purely of muscle and flesh. At our command these abominations will charge at our enemies, bringing true terror into their eyes. No thoughts. No pain. Not even the heaviest gunfire will stop these monsters."
 KRS_boneless_3: "The Boneless"
 KRS_boneless_3_desc: "Deformed remains of the bandits formerly plaguing the Consortium's territory, now turned into an army of misshapen, brainless creatures made purely of muscle and flesh. At our command these abominations will charge at our enemies, bringing true terror into their eyes. No thoughts. No pain. Not even the heaviest gunfire will stop these monsters."
 KRS_economic_stagnation: "Economic Stagnation"
 KRS_economic_stagnation_desc: "Economic growth can be quite fickle, and we now find ourselves in a heavy downturn. The revenue we gained from seizing the majority of North-Western Łódzkie’s usable land and appropriating many of the region’s businesses dried up far quicker than we would’ve hoped as the treasury bleeds more funds by the day. Unless he finds a way to generate some real income, Skrzydlewski’s corporate empire will soon find itself bankrupt, with no central authority to bail out his struggling enterprise."
 KRS_tulip_farms: "Tulip Farms"
 KRS_tulip_farms_desc: "All across the Consortium, unused patches of grassland and old, abandoned fields are being turned by H. Skrzydlewska into tulip farms for profit. Rows of colorful flowers line the side of every road crossing the region. Pink, orange, yellow, red... every shade under the sun can be found in our territory, turning Krośniewice into Europe’s largest tulip market, and a stunning one at that."
 KRS_lab_no_3: "Laboratory No. 3"
 KRS_lab_no_3_desc: "Located deep within Grotnicki forest, the enormous complex works day and night under dr. Ebrantil’s personal supervision, its only contact with the outside world being unmarked trucks bringing in supplies. Besides the official purpose of “developing new technical solutions for the Consortium’s civilian and military sectors”, little is known about what truly happens inside the facility, except for terrified reports of supposed “unspeakable horrors and torture” made by the rare few escapees. \n\n§RThey will have to be silenced.§!"
 KRS_diverted_assets: "Diverted Assets"
 KRS_diverted_assets_desc: "The corporate tendrils of H. Skrzydlewska stretch even further, as not even the military industry finds itself safe from their machinations. Unwilling to simply continue relying on foreign manufacturers, the resources and workforce of the Consortium have been directed to provide equipment both designed and produced fully within the borders of the statelet."
 KRS_chemical_doping: "Chemical Doping"
 KRS_chemical_doping_desc: "Administering drugs to our soldiers greatly increases their performance in battle, reduces the time needed for rest, and negates any risk of morale issues within the army. Units already receiving this “treatment” yield far better results in combat, however, the issue of delivering amounts large enough to truly affect our frontline operations has so far stumped our logisticians."
 KRS_chemical_doping_2: "Chemical Doping & Warfare"
 KRS_chemical_doping_2_desc: "Why bother directly administering the drugs to our soldiers one-by-one, when we can make this matter so much easier by dispensing them in gaseous form over our whole formations? Now we just have to remember which dispensers are to be directed at our boys and which are meant for the enemy. We wouldn’t want any unfortunate accidents, §Rbut who cares about the lives of cannon fodder anyway?§!" 
 KRS_human_experiments: "Human Experiments"
 KRS_human_experiments_desc: "With the right genome enhancements, targeted hormone therapy, and some... very invasive surgery, we can turn those normally unfit for service into capable soldiers. Now everyone will be able to fight and die for the Consortium. §RAnd we’ll make sure they do.§!" 
 KRS_human_terrors: "'Human' Terrors"
 KRS_human_terrors_desc: "Alterations to the brain structure of our test subjects have rendered them completely obedient to our will, stifling any independent thought. They exist purely to serve us, no longer humans, but perfect soldiers, enhanced to the limits of what their bodies will allow."
 KRS_speedway_bikes: "Speedway Bikes"
 KRS_speedway_bikes_desc: "Our decades-long investment into local speedway isn’t such a money sink after all. The bikes allow for mobility unmatched by other warlords in the region. With them, we’ll outmaneuver our rivals, disrupting their supply lines and encircling divisions."

 KRS_weaponised_pavulon_1: "Weaponised Pavulon"
 KRS_weaponised_pavulon_1_desc: "Our paramedics, apart from handling the dead and providing medical services to the Consortium's army, also form the ranks of its chemical warfare corps. In combat, they are known to dispense weaponized muscle relaxants which first disarm the enemy, and then neatly prepare him for capture and further utilization."
 KRS_weaponised_pavulon_2: "Weaponised Pavulon & Experimental Memory Enhancers"
 KRS_weaponised_pavulon_2_desc: "Apart from spiking their enemies with Pavulon, the Łódź Paramedics are also supplying the Consortine army with experimental medicines that improve their performance in training and enhance their mental prowess and help clear their minds in the heat of battle. A stressed, or even afraid soldier is one that can’t reliably fight on the frontlines after all."

 #KRS_rutkowski_patrol_desc: "The famous private police force that everyone knows. The most upstanding of upstanding citizens, the law-keepers and the private eyes of the Consortium. Given practically free reign as being part of the Inner Circle, they serve to protect the local population and keep them in line... so they don’t start getting any ideas."

KRS_up_in_the_town_of_krosniewice_desc: "Up in the town of Krośniewice, a group of three parties meet, \nThe Businessman, The Detective and The Paramedic elite,\nThey shake hands, a fair deal they quickly settle,\nTo the Triumvirate, they freely submit their mettle."
KRS_the_new_agenda_desc: "Our state is plagued with countless problems and all of us know that well, so that’s why a meeting is in order. All three parties in one place to discuss all that ails us and what’s the ointment to aid us. Each and every matter of state, every problem. We will do our best."
KRS_lock_the_doors_desc: "If we are to meet, we’ll need utmost security and who’s better to do that than Rutkowski’s men. His agents will be just the people needed to keep everyone out and keep whatever happens in. We must ensure that our dealings are kept as professional as could be. Hey, we might impress the parties involved if we try hard enough."
KRS_and_begin_the_meeting_desc: "Let our meeting begin! There are alot of things to discuss and a lot of problems to tackle on our first official gathering. Disappearances, Bandits and even just Refugees from worse parts of Poland, or those seeking to travel to the Eurocomissariats are just three of our pressing issues. And for better or for worse, everyone has their own ideas for solving these problems, which makes it abundantly clear that keeping this Triumvirate in balance will be harder than we had previously thought."
KRS_fixin_our_problems_desc: "Crime, the scourge that affects not only our populace, but also reflects poorly on us. This wave of lawlessness spurred by the Fall must be stopped and prevented from happening again. Getting rid of petty criminals is the first step in eliminating these crippling issues from our state. We’ll see what solutions are put forward..."
KRS_educating_civil_servants_desc: "Now, let us talk about preventative measures. We need a more effective system of law enforcement and we need it now. Sure we can buy them all sorts of fancy gear, but what worth is it if they don’t know how to effectively use it? That’s why we’ll need to give them a proper education, not whatever bottom of the barrel course they had to pass to get their cozy job."
KRS_destroying_crime_desc: "The final piece of the puzzle for which we are now adequately prepared for is the goal of completely destroying any bandit activity in our region. Our well educated and well armed law enforcement will have no pity as it pacifies our lands, cracking down on any armed dissenters. The people will surely thank us for finally putting an end to this menace."
KRS_invest_in_a_megaproject_desc: "Every great nation has its grand monuments; amazing works of humankind’s labor and to show that we are a prestigious state, even more so that the ones around us, we shall create a Megaproject of our own. It surely won’t be an easy feat, however when we finish it, everyone will see that we are a beacon of progress and that our cause is one worth supporting."
KRS_conclude_the_meeting_desc: "Now that everything’s over and done with, we can finish our meeting. Licking our admittedly grievous wounds was just the first step however. We can now properly move onto cementing our position in the Voivodeship.\nLet’s hope that the future is not too unkind to us."
KRS_expand_the_patrol_desc: "Rutkowski’s Patrol has so far been an integral part of our state’s law enforcement, serving as detectives leagues better than whatever remains of the Police remain. Due to their skill a proposal has been put forward by Rutkowski, suggesting we allow for the creation of a new branch of his organization. The new branch would focus on leading proper military training for our soldier boys to improve upon our currently very ad-hoc method of training troops."
KRS_prepare_the_airfields_desc: "If war will come to Łódzkie Voivodeship, then we cannot be caught unprepared in the wake of whatever conflict is to come. Our state is littered with all sorts of small airfields which could be repurposed for military use. Fielding more aircraft would be invaluable, as aerial support will greatly bolster our military might, without needing many more men. And besides, it’s not like anyone was actually using those airfields in the first place."
KRS_old_police_weapons_desc: "The Police left behind some pretty nifty toys for our boys to have fun with, so why not make use of them? They might not be top of the line machine guns, but they are high quality firearms regardless. Issue is, almost all of them haven’t been maintained for a very long time now and have fallen into disrepair. We will organize new weapon workshops to fix all of them right up. As a bonus we can later use the same workshops to create brand new guns."
KRS_no_time_to_lose_desc: "Tick, Tock, Tick, Tock...Time is money and we’ve spent all that we can afford. After all of our discussions and all of our preparations we hope we have done enough. We can’t delay any longer. It is time to assert our position as the true rulers of the Voivodeship.\nThe Triumvirate will triumph above everyone else."
KRS_guardin_our_interests_desc: "We need an army, there are no doubts about it. The country has spiraled so far out of control, it is basically impossible to get anything done without a swarm of armed men around you. A standing force should be one of our priorities if we want to assert ourselves as a serious component for the mantle of Łódzkie’s leader."
KRS_controlling_the_border_desc: "Our close proximity to the Eurocomissariats may be considered a boon for some, however it has brought upon more issues than we expected. Waves of refugees from the east constantly travel through our land, slowing down our implementation of law and destabilizing our nation further. There’s something that needs to be done about this issue of ours."
KRS_standard_training_programmes_desc: "Now that the more serious matters are out of the way, we can think about protecting ourselves and not just our whole state as a whole. A private security force for our top leaders needs to be organized, so that they don’t end up as victims of some crazed assassin, or one of the mysterious kidnappers plaguing our lands."
KRS_uppin_our_revenue_desc: "Money, we need it and we need a lot of it. Any state does, how can we buy just about anything from basic resources for our people to advanced tanks for our forces without a steady source of income? That’s why we need to decide on what industries to build up or expand to get this cash."
KRS_contracts_from_abroad_desc: "All of our three groups (surprisingly) agree on one thing - that we are businessmen and running a business on just the local level is really not profitable. Coming to a consensus was not hard, we must expand our ventures to the lands of other warlords. We’ll reach out a seemingly helpful hand, to goad them into coughing up cash for our oh so important services."
KRS_aquiring_resources_desc: "As part of our economic expansion, and the sheer fact the land we carved out for ourselves is not very bountiful has led us to needing more raw materials than we had accounted for. This unexpected problem needs to be solved post haste, unless we wish to risk an economic slowdown."
KRS_battle_for_lodzkie_desc: "Despite Hołownia’s efforts, war in Łódzkie is practically inevitable. We must prepare ourselves to defend our state from anyone wanting to claim it for themselves. We shall create a system of defenses on our borders, everyone who dares test us, will crash and burn trying to break through our lines."
KRS_divert_our_assets_desc: "Currently a lot of our factories are sitting around producing useless junk, instead of making things that will actually benefit us in any meaningful way. Who needs their third microwave, when we could be making rifles for our men instead? Refitting factories that are currently just a drain on our workforce into producing war supplies will put us one step ahead of everyone else in terms of producing weapons."
KRS_patch_the_holes_in_our_logistics_desc: "Supplies do not just magically appear in our soldier’s hands, so we need to fix that with the wonderful world of supply logistics. The issue however is, that we lack the means to transport our gear to the front. To remedy this issue, we’ll produce more transport vehicles. Soon brand new trucks and trains will be transporting our military goods all around our territories."
KRS_establish_a_supply_line_desc: "Well supplied armies are a real force to be reckoned with, so to further bolster our logistics capabilities, we will establish an organized system of supply lines to our fronts. Our soldiers will be able to fight for longer and won’t have to fear running out of bullets in the middle of nowhere, tens of kilometers away from the nearest supply hub."
KRS_establish_an_auxiliary_corps_desc: "A good way to encourage our people to aid in our effort is to create a well paid auxiliary corps. Even some unemployed nobody who simply grabs a shovel and helps us dig anti-tank ditches will be a great help, without needing much in the way of training or advanced skills. When push comes to shove, some of them might even decide to help bolster our army by joining its ranks when their work as auxiliaries ends."
KRS_comfort_families_desc: "Every day since the Fall, people have been dying en masse because of all the chaos that sweeps across the bloody remains of Poland. This has been a huge drain on the morale of our population, to say the least. In order to try and lessen the impact of these turbulent times, we will put on a smile and reimburse our population for the loss of loved ones and any grievous injuries. To curry favors with them of course."
KRS_why_we_fight_desc: "Why do We fight? Is it for wealth? Is it for fame? No, We fight because we must. We are the only ones that can bring back stability and prosperity to this rotting corpse of a once great nation! We need to face adversity from all directions, from all ideals, from old friends and from new enemies! We don’t fight for personal gain, we fight so that the white eagle can soar once more in the skies of Europe!"
KRS_detectives_ready_for_action_desc: "It goes without saying that Rutkowski’s Detectives are incredibly skilled in their field, and their discipline is simply top notch, hence we have decided to employ them as special forces on the front. With a bit of training and some fancy branded military gear highlighting their uniqueness, they will truly stand out from the rest in our army’s ranks."
KRS_conscript_women_desc: "Lack of manpower is an ever present issue in just about any army, including ours.Given this fact, we must make up for this deficit by allowing women to serve within our ranks, and not just men. Well, allow is a bit of an understatement..."
KRS_pass_out_the_pitchforks_desc: "We need more men. Oh so much more than we have currently. No price is too big to pay for our victory in Łódzkie. We will rally everyone, each and every person in our state. Even if they have to share three guns for a whole battalion, we will get them to the front. We will get farmers, drunks, the poor and the homeless, we will have them fight because that is all that we’ve got."
KRS_roll_out_the_paramedics_desc: "Having paramedics assist our soldiers on the front will be very useful in keeping our army from slowly bleeding men. They will establish field hospitals for our men, in which they’ll hopefully get treated well... We don’t want our men looking like WW1 veterans after one single scratch on their leg..."
KRS_experimental_concoctions_desc: "Pervitin and other amphetamines have long been used on the fronts of many, many battles since their conception, so how about we make some of our own? It worked back then, so why would it be a bad idea now? Soldiers that are energetic and ready for battle all around the clock will be a true blessing... We just shouldn’t tell them what we are actually giving them..."
KRS_poisonous_gasses_desc: "Why should we only look to the past when it comes to doping our soldiers? So many wondrous weapons have long been abandoned in the past! Chemical Warfare, while frowned upon, is a true marvel. Who these days has a spare gas mask just lying around? No one is the answer. That’s why using a few less ethical solutions here and there will be just what we need..."
KRS_complex_submolecular_modifications_desc: "Genetic Modification, it just sounds so… unreal… so impossible. It sounds like some far off concept ripped straight out of a space opera, however minor modifications would not be that terribly difficult to accomplish. Given this, we could “modify” some people less fit for service so that they can make it above the minimum requirements to join."
KRS_unleash_the_terrors_desc: "We might have pushed genetically modifying our soldiers a bit too far... At this point it’s hard to call them human. They are completely obedient, they are harder, better, faster, stronger... which would be all well and good... if they didn’t act like savage beasts."

KRS_all_hell_is_breaking_loose_desc: "The lines have been drawn, the guns have been prepared, and the entire voivodeship is gearing up for war. Initial skirmishes between the warlords had already erupted and we needed to prepare our population for an inevitable time of sacrifice.\n\n\nThis will be awful for our profits."
KRS_fortify_our_cities_desc: "Analytics from Rutkowski's Patrol have designated the most populated towns in our lands as critical strongpoints which we should fortify.\nBarricades will be built, trenches will be dug and even houses will be reinforced to make sure that any enemy will think twice before attacking them head-on."
KRS_gather_the_war_council_desc: "The clock is ticking, the top brass of the Clique needs to gather and figure out any potential measures that can help us in case of an armed conflict. We need all hands on deck, anything goes and no idea is a bad one. Whatever crystallizes from this will meeting will have to do, for the good of the Triumvirate."
KRS_skrzydlewski_heritage_desc: "Old Skrzydlewski had a vision.\nA network of flower shops and funeral parlors all around the country, providing beautiful house decorations and funeral services to people in all corners of Poland. He worked his entire life to make that dream come true.\n\nNaturally, after The Fall, his company came upon troubled waters, with many warlords closing his stores and outright seizing them.\nHowever, all that left him a giant logistics fleet, full of distinct blue and white trucks.\nWe can use them to enhance our military supply chain."
KRS_state_funeral_service_desc: "With war, there come casualties and...profits, of course. Why shouldn't we combine those two and offer affordable, yet dignified funerals for all the victims?"
KRS_convert_the_krosniewice_narrow_gauge_railway_desc: "The Krośniewice Narrow-Gauge Railway used to be a popular tourist attraction before The Fall. We should give it a new purpose. Transporting people and supplies in modern trains along these lines would be a great help to us. But first, we need to convert it to standard-gauge... which will cost us time and money."
KRS_use_the_speedway_bikes_desc: "The Skrzydlewski Family is a life-long sponsor of Speedway sports in Łódź. We should repurpose the motorcycles as lightweight, fast recon vehicles for our troops."
KRS_start_the_war_machine_desc: "It’s time. Our forces are stronger than ever and readier than ever. We will dominate Łódzkie!"
KRS_rutkowski_expertise_desc: "Rutkowski is our best bet when it comes to security. We shall use his experience in paramilitary training and his elite unit of detectives on the front lines to secure our victory!"
KRS_hidden_armories_desc: "As it turned out, Mr. Rutkowski possesses a few gun caches,which have been long hidden away from the public (and apparently from us) and he’s willing to donate his state-of-the-art weaponry to the war effort."
KRS_foreign_drill_instructors_desc: "Mr. Rutkowski is a very well-connected man. During one of many of the War Council’s sessions, he came up with the idea of hiring some of his old friends from abroad to train the Clique’s ever-growing army. We won’t skimp out on any funds in such an endeavor."

In the east, worshippers of the mediocre book based on games and other fantastic beasts. To the south, there is a large crater in Bałuty, coal worshipers, half-wits from Widzew and bloodthirsty scouts.

Plus, who can resist our 2-in-1 life insurance offer? Buy one for your family, you'll get extra coffin for a funeral!\n\nAlas, it ain't all fine and dandy. Border crossings are almost besieged, and Rutkowski demands more people to guard the checkpoints. And that's because, in addition to innocent refugees, saboteurs and extremists also can get through. Unless they pay us, or want to make some deal of course. Recently, we even undertook one such interesting business proposal from West Pomerania.

They're very tasty!\n\nEveryone looked at her very surprised. To cut any speculations, she quickly grabbed one of the flowers, plucked out the petals and with a swift move, she put them in her mouth. She was chewing very bravely and calmly to avoid any face grimaces which may have indicated something other than delight. After swallowing, she said:\n-Of course, they taste best cooked. With potatoes. Or groats. Only 5 zloty per piece! They cost 5 Euros per piece in France, and are considered delicacy. Appreciate that Skrzydlewska got them for you! Come and buy!\n\nAnd yes.

How an expensive antique of that kind ended up in an otherwise typical corporate meeting room was anyone’s guess, perhaps for the sheer contrast value of it.\n - Without reforms, there is no progress - He continued - And without progress, no good business can be made.\n\nThe CEO nonchalantly clapped his hands. Two assistants, carrying a whiteboard and big sheets of paper covered in different symbols and letters, emerged from the side door and quickly began to set it up.\n - If we dream of unifying the country and transforming it into a prosperous, rich republic ruled by us and like-minded individuals we need to act quickly, before any of the other so-called governments located in our country can make any real moves.\nHe paused for a second, letting the cold emphasis on the word governments leave an impact on his fellow listeners. Rutkowski let a quick nervous cough out, constantly swapping between looking at the CEO and the Doctor, who did not move at all during his little speech.\n\n - This is why I am overjoyed to see you here. Our expertise, our contacts and our resources combined will transform this little land into an undefeated coalition of prosperous business, lethal force and cutting-edge science. A force to be reckoned with.\nOne of the assistants slowly walked over to the table and began passing out fine cigars. A soft click of a Zippo lighter interrupted the silence. Skrzydlewski thanked the assistant, who quickly ran off, and let out a big puff of flavourful smoke.\n - With that, I would like to officially begin our meeting. Let us waste no more time.

Most of the neighbors don't know what happened as they ignored the pair. Two men were known for their loud drunken ramblings and most of the inhabitants of the neighborhood simply ignored them, while they argued with each other. I also haven't been able to contact Mr. Mokrodolski as he died in the local hospital the same day. One testimony I’ve heard says that their talk that happened at the day of the disappearance was unusually short for them. The person who gave the testimony said she checked what had happened out of curiosity and saw that he was leaving with some surgical mask-wearing man in a trench coat, heading in the general direction of the local clinic. The same clinic Mokrodolski died in. They could have been heading somewhere else, and anyone can wear a face mask so it all might all just be one big coincidence, but something tells me the local paramedics are up to something.

They were quite known in their neighborhood thanks to their long, shouty rants about the 'good old days' that would sometimes last for hours on end and would often wake small babies up, causing the pair to be especially despised by mothers living in nearby flats. \n\n- I'm telling you, Zbysiu - these fools would come up to my window and throw rocks at it! Throw rocks at my window for voicing my support for The Party! Hah, so much for their 'freedom of speech! - Wojtek barked at his older colleague. \n - Exactly! And look... look where their inept liberalism got us! - replied Zbyszek, breathing heavily. His age was starting to take his oratory skills away from him, with his speech becoming slower and more painful with every month. - At least they didn't manage to... ...to take healthcare away from us...

After giving him a quick check-up and accidentally smearing him and his colleague with a small bit of an unknown ointment he had on one of his gloves, the doctor decided that he needs to take him for an hour to the local clinic to conduct a further examination. After a quick goodbye, Wojtek was left alone to himself... and his small flask of whiskey, which he always slowly sipped from when his pal was away. But as he emptied his flask, he noticed that something was wrong... His friend would always come back around the time he was halfway through his drink - he had managed to down the entire flask in one sitting before, and- HOLY SHIT it's been THREE HOURS since Zbyszek and his medic left, where the HELL are they? Hello? Is anyone here? Can anyone hear me? Hello? I cannot feel anything - can anyone hear me? Please?! I beg you?! PLEASE!? PLEASE!?- \n\nWojciech lied unconscious on a small bench, not responding to any words of passers-by who tried to help him. Thankfully, a paramedic who often came here to attend one of his patients arrived on the scene and gave him an injection that managed to wake him up. \n- Sir! Sir, are you there? Hello? Oh thank God you're back. It appears you've passed out from a strong allergic reaction to a cosmetic of sorts.

 krs_meeting.1.desc: "An immediate reform of the military is one of the first talking points of the meeting.\n\nRutkowski’s solution is simple, yet brilliant. It involves turning the Patrol into a formidable fighting force by introducing a large expansion programme. Its first point involved a big recruitment drive, preceded by a nation-wide campaign in all media outlets.\n\nMr. Skrzydlewski, however, has come up with a more direct and quicker solution. In his vision, a sparse amount of the Clique’s budget should be invested into hiring Private Military Contractors, who would protect the borders until the Patrol can be properly expanded at a later time.\n\nDoctor Ebrantil’s idea is the most divisive, yet the most intriguing of them all. He revealed that the Paramedic Laboratory is working on something called the 'J-22 Compound''. The details of its effects are not yet publicly known, which makes Rutkowski a little skeptical, but Ebrantil seems fully convinced of its incredible potential as a chemical warfare agent.\n\nThe resources allocated to this particular issue are limited, what is our choice?"

 krs_meeting.2.desc: "The ongoing refugee crisis is another important issue debated during the meeting.\n\nMr. Skrzydlewski is fully convinced to jump at the opportunity and press as many refugees into our workforce as humanly possible. His PR team’s idea involves a full-blown advertisement campaign by the border that includes billboards, loudspeakers, benefits for the fresh-employed and a plenty of good, old fashioned corporate astroturfing inside the makeshift refugee camps.\n\nHowever, Detective Rutkowski finds the idea outrageous, pointing at glaring security issues that would arise by letting a gigantic wave of people settle inside our borders. In his strongly-voiced opinion, the increase of criminal activities and possibility of foreign infiltration is not worth the risk. Instead, he proposes to lock the border down with police equipped with riot equipment, to curb any disorder among the refugees.\n\nEbrantil, being himself, decides that „he would take care of the issue in a beneficial way”. No concrete explanation to that statement has been given, but backroom talks during the discussions have rumored about a need for „volunteers'', who would help the Paramedics in future experiments.\n\nWe cannot let this crisis deepen, what is our choice?"

 krs_meeting.3.desc: "If we want to protect our interests, we need an army, and one of the first steps to achieve that is to establish a standard training programme for its soldiers.\nMr. Skrzydlewski is especially passionate about this issue. In his mind, the Patrol should become a highly specialized formation of corporate security that would primarily focus on protecting already established assets, and adjusting the programme accordingly is the best choice.\n\nRutkowski’s vision is a little different, as it involves leaving the Patrol’s training programme as is, with a focus on investigative work, irregular tactics and V.I.P security, as well as protection of certain Point-Of-Interests. Keeping it small, but professional should be sufficient, seeing how our army is still one of the best-equipped in the region.\n\nEbrantil’s idea, as always, proves to be the most controversial. Seeing how other warlords of the region seem to enlarge their forces at an alarming pace, the Clique should do the same, which is why the training programme should be as simple and idiot-proof as possible. That, however, will turn our army into a large, yet unprofessional militia, while cementing the Patrol’s role as the elite, special force to be used when the state’s interest demands.\n\nOur soldiers need to receive training, what is our choice?"

Looking at the extent of it, it is safe to say that a myriad of different things contributed to its appearance.\nThe heads of the Triumvirate, however, cannot agree on which one of them is the defining one and should be tackled first.\n\nMr. Skrzydlewski argues that the corrupted civil administration, a relic of the old Polish state, is responsible for this state of affairs. In turn, his proposition consists of weeding out the troublemakers by helping the public in “electing” a new mayor of Krośniewice, who is our de facto leader, when it comes to administrating our civilian population. His proposed candidate is supposed to be incorruptible, and he promised to spare no expense in helping her to reach power.\n\nDetective Rutkowski believes the cause to be much more straightforward - a conspiracy, stretching far and wide across our country. The bandits could be anywhere. Even your neighbor can be one, that’s right! This is why he proposes to establish a network of Patrol informants in all echelons of our society. In turn, it would allow the Patrol to gather more intelligence on potential criminals and spies, and thus be able to prevent any hostile acts in a more efficient manner.\n\nEbrantil is much more… straightforward in his ideas. In his eyes, it’s an issue of an alarming number of dissidents that allow banditry to grow and drain the Clique of precious resources. And those dissidents must be removed in a beneficial way.The details of his proposed solution are quite murky, but it involves camps. And a cooperation with a local meat packing plant. \n\nSo, which of those proposed ideas shall we settle on?"

The thing is, what exactly should we educate them on?\n\nMr. Skrzydlewski believes that it’s best to reorganize our civil service akin to a company. This is why he thinks that the main line of education should focus on making our civil servants into low-level business managers, who, by using their position, can protect the interests of the Consortium, and by that, the interests of the whole Triumvirate.\n\nDetective Rutkowski believes this to be the perfect occasion to improve our defensive capabilities. He proposes to teach our civil servants basics of self-defense, small-scale unit tactics and skills necessary to conduct an investigation. In his vision, this would help in case of a sudden low-level insurgency in the country and provide a number of ready recruits for the Patrol.\n\nIn a shocking display of compassion, Doctor Ebrantil believes that teaching our civil servants basic medicine will improve the access to healthcare in our more remote areas, and by that, will improve the standards of living, which will result in a decrease of crime.\n\nHowever, we cannot overburden our civil servants with too many duties, what will be our choice?"

The question is, what should we exactly do with them? These are hardened, experienced killers. Mr. Skrzydlewski argues that their services could be beneficial for the state, and thinks that hiring them to be an official part of the Consortium is the best course of action. Naturally, this opinion doesn’t sit well with Detective Rutkowski. They might be useful, but in the end, they are still bandits that cannot be trusted. But, they can still prove useful, as workers in a chain of labor camps that the Patrol would like to operate. If there’s a sure way for them to repay the state for their misdeeds, it’s this one. And, of course, there’s also Doctor Ebrantil. He also believes that the bandits have some use in the form of enlisting them into the military after a series of… modifications.

The image of corporate skyscrapers towering over Krośniewice strokes the wildest fires of imagination. We can change this country for the better, remove all business restrictions that plagued it Pre-Fall, and get filthy rich in the process. For that to happen, however, we need to drag our economy out of the gutter. The situation in our many business partners’ borders is rapidly deteriorating, and so are our profits. Many projects with huge potential had to be sidelined, or canceled altogether. However, there’s one opportunity to divert a significant portion of our assets towards a megaproject that could potentially turn the tide of our dying economy and bring it back to the top. But, the heads of the Triumvirate can’t really agree on which project should be chosen.\n\nThe Consortium proposes to use big, empty and fertile areas of our country and convert them into tulip farms. With just enough time, money and manpower, our tulips will surpass those harvested in the Netherlands, and, in turn, will allow us a steady supply flow towards our flower shops, and a steady flow of profits. Rutkowski doesn’t really agree with that idea. Instead, he thinks that the best choice of action is renting out a few of our many Patrol units to different warlords all around Poland. He argues that it’s both a good way to train our troopers for an upcoming conflict, and a way to acquire funds for our economy. Ebrantil’s idea, as always, seems very risky, but could be very profitable in the long run. He wants to use our sparse funds to build an enormous research facility that would double as an ultra-effective chemical plant. In passing, he mentioned something about “more meat”, leaving everyone to wonder what that entails.\n\nWe need to allocate our funds smartly, what should we focus on?"

We need to pinpoint a few key areas that could use their support and focus on one that will receive the most of their generosity. Skrzydlewski’s Family still has a lot of assets left all around what used to be Poland. Boarded up funeral homes, burnt out flower shops and empty logistics centers might not be too much, but with just enough assistance, they can be turned back into a prosperous empire that provides funerals all across the country. On the other hand, the Detective could catch up with some old friends of his, back from his days in Austria. A little visit and a few gifts should be enough for them to lend us their expertise. And guns. Doctor Ebrantil, shocking everyone with a surprising amount of compassion, proposes to use his… acquaintances from the East to provide our market with lots of cheap, affordable medicine substitutes that would allow our citizens better quality healthcare, or so he says at least.\n\nAfter a long series of debates and arguments, the heads decided on..."

Plenty of small businesses exist in the town of Krośniewice and the surrounding area. Junkyards, factories, shops, warehouses. All full of useful materials that could be used for the needs of the Clique. Of course, they won’t be too happy to share those without compensation. Sadly, our current budget does not allow us to provide those. Thankfully, Mr. Skrzydlewski came up with a slightly different idea. What if we just take them without paying? Detective Rutkowski seems outraged by this, though. Instead, he thinks that the best way is to send our most overzealous, most formal inspectors to the streets so that they may plunder each and every piece of evidence of any crime that they can find, and then find a suitable use for them. There is one proposal that doesn’t involve strong-arming competitors or looting each and every item from law-bending citizens. Dr. Ebrantil has come up with a project.

The Patrol argues for something that would show our military might to the world. A well fortified Headquarters, equipped with a series of fortifications, anti-air defenses, a prison complex and a surveillance center among others is a sure way to show every single saboteur and traitor that Detective Rutkowski doesn’t play around when it comes to matters of national security. And finally, top researchers of The Paramedics want to ensure that our nation will never fall from the position of being a technological leader by establishing the Krośniewice Institute of Medical Sciences. Despite raising some eyebrows, Doctor Ebrantil ensures that nothing, §Rnothing§! besides the usual procedures is going to happen inside the building.\n\nOur recovery needs a tangible symbol, what should we choose?"

krosniewice.1001.desc: "Who would've guessed a mercenary company would thrive in a post-apocalyptic reality? Having made a fortune by offering protection and detective services to frightened consumers allowed Rutkowski to amass enough wealth to become the largest shareholder among the companies constituting the Consortium. He's already centralizing his power as the de facto ruler and uses all of the Consortium's assets to ensure safety in towns and roads which not so long ago were infested by numerous bandits. Citizens of the Consortium can sleep peacefully as no case is too insignificant, or too daunting for the fame-hungry detective."

Little is known about the mysterious Dr. Ebrantil, besides the rumors of his cooperation with Skrzydlewski go back to long before the Fall. His spokesmen claim that the Paramedics acquired the dominant position thanks to their innovativeness and a shrewd use of resources that were amassed before the Fall. Their business plan, whilst shrouded in mystery, shall continue under their watchful eye.\nSome people accuse Ebrantil of being the perpetrator of the infamous Skin Hunter scandal, who will only expand his nefarious schemes as time goes on. Such voices are quickly silenced by bribery, lawsuits or... other means."

 ##Characters##
POLITICS_WITOLD_SKRZYDLEWSKI_DESC: "The line between cut-throat business practices and pure psychopathy is a thin one, with the constant pressure for ever-increasing growth creating a soul-crushing grind. Those who rise to the top never do so unscathed, as to always remain ahead of the similarly ambitious competition, hell-bent on upending the corporate order, requires one to sacrifice their §Rmorals§! on the altar of the §Gmighty Dollar§!. Or perhaps, like in the case of Witold Skrzydlewski, they never had them to begin with... \n\nHaving inherited a humble florist business from his retiring mother, Skrzydlewski was far from content to let it merely remain so. Through fierce expansion, diversification into the funeral industry, and following hegemonic monopolization, the tycoon increasingly cornered the established magnates, putting them out of business one-by-one, until §Gonly H. Skrzydlewska remained on the economic battlefield as the undisputed victor§!. At least that is the sanitized version of the story that Skrzydlewski would like the public to know. After all, the real methods of ensuring his success were far less humane.   \n\nIn truth, the exponential spiral of corporate advancement was aided by all kinds of shady dealings, including with the now-infamous §RSkin Hunters§!, who graciously provided their services of cold-blooded murder of vulnerable patients to the highest bidder. Throughout the years, whenever the seemingly serene funeral industry intersected with crime, Skrzydlewski was always in the center of events, usually as the culprit. Yet, at times, even the Necrobaron would find himself outplayed, and the failed attempt on his life was more than enough of an impulse to cut ties with the underworld and sanitize his image. Since then, the Tycoon has worked hard to regain public favor, eventually earning rapport within the community through a number of high-profile ventures. And yet, the ruthless businessman in him was not gone, he simply remained in hibernation, waiting for the right time to re-emerge. \n\nGiven his guile and established network of connections, it was only natural that for Skrzydlewski the Fall meant not danger, but §Gunprecedented opportunity§! instead. Rather than quietly sit on the sidelines and watch the tide of events unfold, as soon as authority within the voivodeship collapsed, the tycoon gathered up his assets and forcefully established a corporate state in a final grand expansion of H. Skrzydlewska. Such action wouldn’t be possible without the use of a few §Rold contacts§!, however – ones that wouldn’t lend their services without a heavy dose of influence over the newfound Consortium. In his greatest gambit, the Necrobaron has been forced to cooperate with the worst demons of his troubled past. It remains to be seen whether the aging tycoon can keep them in check, securing an §Geverlasting legacy for the company he brought from obscurity all the way to the national stage§!, or whether the §Rechoes of his crimes§! will come to haunt him at last."

POLITICS_KRZYSZTOF_RUTKOWSKI_DESC: "To not only survive but also thrive in the cut-throat landscape of the Consortium’s politics takes a certain kind of toughness. As Skrzydlewski’s corporate state grinds a profit out of the withering lands of Łódź, it leaves all those with at least some heart left in them by the wayside. Perhaps no man exemplifies the values of those whose who remain quite like Krzysztof Rutkowski. Cunning, ruthless, and not afraid to bend the rules and put morals aside, the detective will stop at nothing to reach his ambitions. And it appears even the Necrobaron himself, now simply pushed to the wayside, couldn’t halt Rutkowski’s machinations. \n\nRising to prominence in the early days of the Third Republic, Rutkowski’s fame showcased the country’s desperate need for success stories among the constant stream of everyday mediocrity. As the optimism of newfound sovereignty slowly faded, the detective remained as one of the few figures rising above the gray muck, his mythos, built over a series of notable cases, forever enshrined in the nation’s memory. \n\nDespite his star fading, Rutkowski’s repour would prove enough to sustain him throughout the twenties, his times as a detective now merely a source of nostalgia. He was evidently not meant to be granted a quiet retirement, however, as in the midst of the country’s collapse a mystery would emerge unlike any other in his career. With the perpetrator of the Bałuty nuclear strike unknown, it fell upon Rutkowski to solve his grandest case yet. Assembling the patrol together for the first time in years, the detective soon found himself in the employ of Witold Skrzydlewski, forming the Consortium’s security apparatus. \n\nOver the following months, Rutkowski spent his time meticulously accruing influence, eventually strongarming the Necrobaron into giving up control of his enterprise. The detective now leads the statelet with his dedicated corps of mercenaries, ready to play kingmaker among Poland’s numerous warlords. What they fail to realize in their petty squabbles over ideology is that war above all means §Gprofit.§! And Rutkowski is ready to turn their misery and conflict into a true money-making machine."
POLITICS_EBRANTIL_DESC: "A horrifying revelation awaits anyone who dares to venture deep into the Flower Consortium’s politics. Despite Skrzydlewski’s appearance of control, the true power lies within the hands of a man so wicked, the potential revelation of the depths of his depravity might just prove enough to unify all the other warlords in an effort to contain him. Hidden behind a mask of flesh, the twisted expression of Dr. Ebrantil haunts Poland, as the terror once seen in the dying eyes of his patients spreads across Łódź, his influence corrupting the Emergency Services from the selfless humanitarians of days gone by into his personal playground, a shadow government in the halls of power and heartless killers on the streets of Kutno. \n\nUnbeknownst to the docile §Rlab rats§!, known in the rest of the voivodeship simply as §G“people”§!, the roots of the carousel of horror engulfing the fallen nation stretch all the way to the founding of the Third Republic. It was then, during his days as an EMS trainee, that a previously unassuming man realized he was... different than the rest of his classmates. He scoffed at their bleeding hearts, their will to do anything to save the life of another. He would still begrudgingly perform his work, of course, anything for the money after all, and the story could have very well ended here had he not found his enabler. Just like today, Witold Skrzydlewski’s cash flow would graciously unleash Dr. Ebrantil’s madness on the populace. As they died in the Pavulon-induced agony, staring into their future leader's soulless eyes, Łódź’s helpless benevolently served the interests of the two men for the final time, a source of profit for one, of twisted purpose for the other. \n\nWhen he invited the mad scientist under his wing for the second time, Skrzydlewski truly believed he could control Dr. Ebrantil. Instead, he would find himself the puppet of a demon in human skin. The necropolis of Kutno churns more and more bodies each day, some for gruesome experiments that create unholy amalgamations, others for their precious §Rblood§!, the rest simply for the new leader’s sick pleasure. There is nobody left to curtail his deranged mind.  \n\n§RNot even God can save Poland now.  \n\nThe people can only pray for a quick and painless death.§!"
