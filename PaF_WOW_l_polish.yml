unification.113.desc:0 "To some, the Fall was an event not brought from within, but rather an inevitable result of foreign machinations. For months this conspiracy festered among supporters of the old regime, yet without a warlord’s backing, it risked being forever swept into the dustbin of history. But, in the upper echelons of the Warsaw Military District, it has finally found its sponsor. Enamored with the theory, Antoni Macierewicz has sworn revenge upon both EU and Russian forces, calling for a general mobilization of the Polish nation. Though his measures may seem extreme, the sheer military might of the Mad Marshall’s military allowed him to overpower and eliminate all warlord factions within the capital. Now that Warsaw lies firmly in his grasp, the city’s industrial capability and overwhelming population are certain to be fully utilized to bolster the army’s ranks. Though they may not know it yet, the millions that call the region home shall soon become soldiers in the coming wars of reunification."
