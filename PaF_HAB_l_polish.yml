unification.146.t: "[GetNewspaper]Grand Duchy of Kraków unifies Lesser Poland!"
unification.146.desc: "The northern half of the Lesser Poland voivodeship has been united under a single force, and memories of times long past seem to be returning quickly, as the austrophiles in power seek to turn Poland into a monarchy based on the long-dead Austro-Hungarian Empire. It is unknown what sort of relation to the Republic of Austria these people seek, but they are dead set on recreating as many elements of Austria-Hungary’s political system as they can.\n\nThey are led by popular media personality and chef Robert Makłowicz, who is known for being an avid fan of Austria-Hungary and a supporter of creating a political system similar to that of the nation which collapsed in 1918. This is, without a doubt, one of the most politically interesting movements to emerge from the Polish anarchy, but we will have to wait quite a while to see what becomes of them, as the war is still raging on"
unification.146.a: "Gott Erhalte!"

unificationreg.146.t: "[GetNewspaper]Grand Duchy of Kraków solidifies control over Lesser Poland!"
unificationreg.146.desc: "The Habsburg monarchy restorationists of the statelet known as the Grand Duchy of Krakow have now conquered a new frontier. Taking control of the Podhale region allowed them to fully control the Małopolskie voivodeship, where they are biding their time, preparing for the next move. Under Makłowicz’s leadership they have begun their journey to transform their torn country into a different state right out of the olden days. Their current goal is to further expand in the area, establishing a new base in former Galicia-Lodomeria, from where they may unify the country.\n\nThe government is encouraging its citizens to learn more about both local history, and the history of former Austro-Hungarian countries in order to strengthen the general public’s belief in their ideas. And while some people may treat these policies as just another LARP, their success so far has been greater than most had imagined, and they may still get the chance to transform Poland according to their own will"
unificationreg.146.a: "We keep the black-and-yellow flag flying here"

unificationsupreg.146.t: "[GetNewspaper]Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria returns!"
unificationsupreg.146.desc: "A very important milestone has been achieved in the war for Polish unification, as the austrophile monarchists who originated as merely one of the many factions in Kraków have brought a rather large chunk of Polish territory under their authority, including the entire “Western Galicia” region, which was historically the Polish side of the old Galicia-Lodomeria, along with other territories to the west, such as the Holy Cross and Lubelskie voivodeships, under their control, effectively making it so that they control a greater portion of Poland than the Austrians themselves ever did.\n\nMany have noticed that this movement is nowhere near as reactionary as most of the various restorationist movements seen throughout Poland, promoting a system based on equality rather than aristocratic elitism. This is a rare and strange occurrence, but the state has already become quite prominent, and from here there’s nowhere left to go but forward"
unificationsupreg.146.a: "In with the old."

super.60.t: "New and improved Kingdom of Poland"
super.60.desc: "The bloody civil war raging across Poland has finally ended, as Poland stands united once again – this time under a monarchy. Strangely enough, this State has been arranged in a similar manner to Austria-Hungary, due to Austro-Hungarian history being the second greatest passion (next to cooking) of its founder, Robert Makłowicz, who has since been named the Arch-Regent of this renewed Kingdom of Poland. And even though the Austrians were considered oppressors back when they still controlled a portion of Poland, Makłowicz’s widely popular policies have caused a generally optimistic attitude towards this new government to spread among the populace.\n\nInternational observers struggle to predict the possible consequences of this event, and the Austrians themselves are absolutely dumbfounded, but have not denounced the Polish government as of yet. It is hard to say if the Regent’s government can fix all of Poland's problems, but one thing remains certain – this is the beginning of a new era in local history"
super.60.a: "Myth of Galicia-Lodomeria comes true"
