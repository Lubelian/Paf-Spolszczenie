unification.83.desc:0 "The sounds of gunfire are slowly being replaced by church bells in Kuyavia, as the battle for the voivodeship finally draws to a close. Of all the religious leaders vying for control of the region it seems that the most radical of them has won. A strong believer in traditional values and national strength, Father Kneblewski has created a state built on discipline and earthly sacrifice. Refugees speak of unchecked tyranny, as church attendance has been declared mandatory, with offenders severely punished as reports of beatings and at times even executions begin to trickle in. Loyal brigades now train in preparation to march on even further as warriors from all around Poland gather in Bydgoszcz, heeding the call for a crusade to retake the broken nation."
