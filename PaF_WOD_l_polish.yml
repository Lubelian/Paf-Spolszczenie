 unification.22.t: "[GetNewspaper]The Legion of Honor unifies Upper Silesia!"
 unification.22.desc: "The cradle of Silesia was ruthlessly tainted by hordes of neo-Nazis. Although they describe themselves as patriots and nationalists, they have no problem relating to the symbolism that comes from the common core of fascism. The population of Silesia was largely enslaved and sent to forced labor in various camps. Those who have missed death and slavery live in constant fear for there is no cover of justice behind which they can hide from the legion's henchmen.\nThere is, however, an entirely second society. The exalted caste. The Aryan race. They live in a completely separate world, filled with luxuries (mostly from stolen homes) and the embodiment of the Legion's dreams of the ubermensch race. However, few of the conquered territories receive this "honor", most of them are meritorious warriors or genetically inclined individuals.\nCan the rest of the country stop this madness? Will the world have to intervene? Otherwise, history will come full circle again. This time in Poland."

 super_a.22.t: "[GetNewspaper]The Legion of Honor unifies Poland!"
 super_a.22.desc: "Magic is not a real thing. So how the hell Poland is now under the reing of a man, who died around 30 years ago? Some people say that the powerful necromancer raised him from the grave - most accurately by accident.\n\nThis unfortunate "accident" costed Poland its freedom. When identity of Szczerski was revealed, even more nationalists rallied to his banners. Considered by some extremists a messiah, Szczerski himself executed those who made such comparisons or event dared to talk about how he's alive.\n\nNevertheless, Legion of Honor now holds Poland in a thight grip, and they're preparing to lead this country into a new era of conquests and 'prosperity'. For they must secure the existence of their people, and a future for white children, as they eagerly say. God is truly dead..."

 super_b.22.t: "[GetNewspaper]The Legion of Honor unifies Poland!"
 super_b.22.desc: "When neonazis took over Wodzisław Śląski, many thought that this is a pinnacle of Polish craziness. But when those people saw legions of nazi stormtroopers marching victorious through Warsaw, burning Częstochowa to the ground, and executing every priest and non-aryan they could find - nobody was laughing.\n\nCult of Odin was declared as a state religion, those who opposed were brutally executed and sacrificed. Sky turned red from fires raging across the whole country, and rivers turn into blood streams as remains of Polish catholics were pouring down the Vistula into the Baltic Sea.\n\nAs it were not enough, Mariusz Szczerski proclaimed himsels a Son of Odin, changing his name to Magnus Odinsson. Population of Poland is now rapidly declining, and soon Poland may end up in ashes and become a song of a past."
