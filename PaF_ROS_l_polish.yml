POLITICS_VLADIMIR_PUTIN_DESC:0 "Merely a decade ago, Vladimir Putin could claim to be the world’s most powerful man. By his decree, new countries were born, while others died under the tracks of Russian tanks. With only a single word, he could make the world tremble in fear as he played the western powers like a fiddle, meticulously growing Russia’s influence from the neutered republic he inherited from Yeltsin to once again being the planet’s second and Eurasia’s foremost superpower. It seemed Putin’s legacy among the nation’s greatest leaders was forever secure, the only questions surrounding his reign being which monicker would best describe his achievements in the annals of history once he steps down in triumph at last. But all statesmen eventually make a fatal mistake, and it took only one miscalculation for the house of cards that kept the President in power for nearly a quarter of a century to crumble.  \n\nOn the muddy fields of Ukraine Putin’s reputation as the king of Realpolitik died along hundreds of thousands of Russian men as the country became a diplomatic pariah, supported only by a handful of third-world dictators. As soon as the army retreated back across the border in shame, the jackals in Moscow began planning their leader’s downfall. Oh, how fickle is the will of the oligarchs that the second their benefactor ceased to bring them wealth and glory, they abandoned the ship, leaving the captain to go down with it alone?  \n\nIn the end, it was the one man who dared to openly defy Putin at the height of his power that would end up taking his throne. Supported by the internal opposition, the wealthy elites and western capital alike, Navalny barely had to break a sweat to oust his predecessor. Abandoned by all but his closest allies, only the exclave of Kaliningrad proved to be safe from the new leader’s wrath.  \n\nNow reduced to a mere rump state, his health ailing, Putin plots his return back home at any cost. The collapse of Poland has been a blessing. Perhaps if he manages to conquer Russia’s age-old enemy, the kingmakers in the capital will see him as their hero once more and he’ll reclaim his rightful place in the sun, the perfect final chapter for the Motherland’s greatest soldier."

rosja.2.desc:0 "History repeats itself, this time as a farce. The Western Military District of Russia has failed miserably in a fight with a few disorganized warlord states of Polish Anarchy, which have banded together to form the Anti-Russian Front. The Russian military has found itself stuck in the lakes and forests of Masuria, ill-prepared for an offensive in such harsh terrain and has been constantly harassed by Polish partisans. \n\nA ceasefire has been signed, and the Russians have agreed to retreat from all territories previously owned by Poland. The little prestige Russia still enjoyed is lost, and the world's laughingstock country is in a state of unrest. It is expected that Kaliningrad will witness a rapid collapse of its current authority and a brutal struggle for power."

rosja.3.desc:0 "Many thought it was but a matter of time until Russians would try to move their forces further into Polish territory. In a recent proclamation from the authorities of the Western Military District about the commencement of "special dewarlordisation operation" has made it clear this time has come now. \nAlthough the attack is nominally a rogue action by the Kaliningrad authorities, the Russian government hasn't given an official response to it, and Russian forces in Belarus are not crossing the border. There is no consensus as to whether this is the Kremlin's plan to localize the conflict, attempting to bog down rivals in the power struggle or an actual insubordination of the westernmost subject. \nPolish warlords engaged by Russian forces have formed the Anti-Russian Front. Despite their desperate defense, the operation is expected to last a few weeks at best due to complete technological, logistical and numerical Russian advantage."

unification.56.desc:0 "Yet another mortal enemy of the Polish nation has again taken a part of it for themselves. Authorities of the Western Military District of Russia have proclaimed they’ve successfully occupied the whole former Warmian-Masurian voivodeship. Although resistance among the civilian population is significant and guerillas are abundant, main urban centers are fully controlled by the Russians. \n\nAlthough the result of the conflict was predictable, the fate of Russian-occupied Poland is not. Many claim a Polish puppet state will be established, others suspect a more eclectic statehood emerging on the former Prussian lands, while some expect simply military occupation or annexation. \n\nNo one doubts that Russia won't stop at this stage, and will sooner or later attempt to devour further pieces of Poland. However, as fear, hate, and resentment grow, it seems certain that another invasion will be met with much stronger resistance."
