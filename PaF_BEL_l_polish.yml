unification.102.desc:0 "In a completely unexpected turn of events, an unlikely power has managed to stake their claim over Podlachia. It is a well known fact that Belarus has been annexed into Russia some time ago, yet lesser known was the fact that the Exiles of its former government have managed to secure a position in the city of Hajnówka and its surrounding regions. Having braved the turbulent realities of constant war in Podlachia, they had managed to pacify the local population and create a faux Belarussian state in de facto Polish territory. Lukashenko in his radio address mocked the Pre-Fall government, claiming that the barriers they constructed now only served to keep him in Poland. Rousing speeches of reclaiming Belarus have been said a dozen times before, however the former president has thus far neglected to mention the future fate of Poland under his leadership. Only time will tell what moves the Exiles will make."
