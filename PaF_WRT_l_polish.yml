unification.153.desc:0 "The Northern Lands of Greater Poland have been reunified under German rulership once more, yet not by the might of Berlin, but instead by the pioneers of the Second Ostsiedlung that settled in the valleys of the Warta River following the Invasion. Abandoned in the wake of the Eurokommissariats’ collapse, left to the wolves and expected to quickly perish to the retributive vengeance of the Polish warlords, through fierce guerilla warfare and desperate conscription, the frontiersmen nevertheless managed to defend their adopted homeland against several better-trained and equipped forces. \n\nThe Naturschutzverein now finds itself in control of vast swathes of territory, inhabited by a bitter and hostile Polish population. And though the willpower and determination of the German settlers are second to none, the continued survival of the relatively minuscule minority’s state is far from guaranteed."
