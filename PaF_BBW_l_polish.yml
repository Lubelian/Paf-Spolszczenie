BBW_steam_power: "Industrializm bez granic"
BBW_steam_power_desc: ""Technologia, która jest zakazana w innych krajach, znów triumpfuje. Jesteśmy jednymi z ostatnich bastionów i wolności gdzie szpony klimatystów jeszcze nie dosięgają. Energia czarnego złota napędza tramwaje parowe, elektrownie, maszyny i wypełnia nasze serca dumą. Niestety, przez lata zaniedbań i zmotywowanego ideologicznego zielonego nacisku, zostaliśmy w tyle za naszymi sąsiadami pod względem tej technologii. Bezlitośnie, jednakże, nadchodzi dzień kiedy węgiel pokaże swój prawdziwy potencjał wszystkim i zdrowy rozsądek zatriumpfuje.""
BBW_smog: "Poziom zanieczyszczeń: mniejszy"
BBW_smog_desc: "Zielony faszyzm potrzebuje swoich mitów po to, aby mógł istnieć. Jak we wszystkich totalitarnych systemach, idole, w których nie można, kwestionować potrzebują utrzymać iluzję, która daje im wytchnienie od myślenia. Najbardziej żałosnym fetyszem zielonych szaleńców jest na pewno smog. Każda nieco ciemniejsza chmura, każdy nawet najbardziej subtelny zapach ciężkiej uczciwej pracy i sukcesu sprawia, że ekolodzy dostają świra.

BBW_street_anger: "Wściekłość na ulicach"
BBW_street_anger_desc: "It seems not everybody shares our concept of justice. The Trial of the Three, while fair, has served as a catalyst for the people’s anger, and it seems the terrorists had quite a bit more popular support than we estimated. The streets of Poland’s industrial capital are now littered with cheap environmentalist propaganda, as widespread strikes grind production in our factories to a halt. We are losing control and if we don’t find a way to quell the unrest, the tide of discontent will paralyze the function of our state."
BBW_street_anger2: "Eskalacha gniewu"
BBW_street_anger2_desc: "Due to our inaction, the protests have escalated into a full-blown riot. Instead of seeing our benevolence in letting them run rampant all over our streets, the eco-fascists are now calling for our heads. They label us murderers and soulless polluters, slander the good name of coal, and attempt to overthrow our regime in the name of their fictional green utopia. If we don’t take decisive action soon, the rioters might soon realize their strength and march directly on our positions. Several paladins have already started drafting evacuation plans and new identities. §RThe time is running out...§!"
BBW_street_anger3: "Ukierunkowany gniew"
BBW_street_anger3_desc: "Information is a powerful tool and whoever controls it can make the people do his bidding without question. In the end, it didn’t take a single bullet to dismantle the riots. All we had to do was manufacture new enemies to redirect the anger of the masses onto, utilizing their fanatical hatred for our own benefit. The same people who just a few weeks ago chanted for our death, now hail us as heroes who uncovered the horrific truth of foreign machinations bringing Poland down into its current ruin. With carefully picked scraps of information, we can turn even the worst eco-fascists into upstanding paladins. §RShould they ever discover the depths of our deception, however, the wrath of the betrayed will be impossible to contain.§!"

Their fickle businesses spring out of the ground, only to quickly wither as dreams of fortune fail to materialize. Most of them are nothing more than fools, inept with their finances, they are however fiercely loyal to our cause. As such, we can direct a portion of our surplus right into their pockets. Some within the Brotherhood refer to this subsidy as “an act of socialism”, but this is as pro-business as it gets. After all, the money will find its way back into our hands one way or another, the guaranteed allegiance of the lucky group of newly “self-made” men is merely a bonus."

BBW_trial_of_three_desc: "It worked. Finally, after months of struggling, we have managed to catch the bombers responsible for blowing up the Brotherhood post in Szczerców. We caught them almost red-handed - while they were preparing another bomb in one of their caches in Bełchatów itself. Soon there will be a meeting of the Elder Council that will decide their fate. It still bothers me… What made them do it? We gave them electricity, we maintained civilization and we developed it, in spite of the turmoil caused by the war. How could they give up their normal life and… kill these people. Three teenagers, they've barely graduated. Why would they murder others in cold blood? There is still so much confusion... I don't understand why the investigation team waited until the day of the trial to announce they had found evidence ... My God, let this madness finally be over..."

They couldn't break through the cordon of people chanting "death" in the direction of the transport bus.\n\nI haven't left the house today. I tried to cut myself off from all the confusion for a moment by writing a new book, but nothing wants to stick. I just keep walking back and forth. A moment ago, Tomek called, he said that in the city people are still standing in the streets. Among them members of the victims' families were seen dressed in black. I can't sit here forever, but what should I do? If we try to get the situation under control, we will turn out to be soulless as PiS rabble from before the war. No, we can't appear to be like them. One must wait and pray that time will heal all wounds. The guards will be on high alert, but I hope they won't have to leave the barracks. It's over for today. I need to sleep; I have to be in full strength. We don't know what tomorrow will bring."

You know what's waiting right under our noses. The Brotherhood Council meeting is in three hours' time, attendance is mandatory.”\n\nHe hung up after those words. I walked over to the guard and let him know I was going out onto the balcony. The cigarette glow was the only thing that illuminated the area around my dacha. There was a deafening silence all around. Just the murmuring of the sentries in the bushes. I took a drag off my cigarette and smoke filled my lungs. The tension somewhat eased. But I still felt blood pulsing rapidly through my veins. If Łukasz addresses someone by their title in an informal conversation, it means that whatever it is really, really bad\n\n- “Knight Marek!” - I growled at the sentry behind the glass balcony door. – “Get the car ready.

People go to work in the mines, shops, workshops, just like before, but nothing changes about me. Today, these teenagers' testimonies landed on my desk. They were terribly vague. But it is impossible not to notice how much hatred was contained in them. Although they were handcuffed, they threatened that the days of the Brotherhood are numbered, that someone would finally take us on and that the power plants would be all blown up. And the slogans about killing nature... Here's our reward for trying to maintain at least a little bit of normality for the people. They wanted to kill us for pork chops on tables, electricity in sockets and running water in the taps. They said we have blood on our hands of all those who will be swallowed by the doom that we will bring..."

BBW_marble_monuments_desc: "$20,000. Expensive. But in this case there can be no cutting corners. We cannot allow ourselves to appear weak. They must be great, dignified. Just like the people and deeds they praise. Italian marble will be transformed into an image of might and significance by the best artists available to us -  the former students of the Łódź Academy of Fine Arts. Inside, there will be a large, steel stove from which smoke will rise forever - a symbol of work, transformation and power. Something that will make the miserable explosion of a makeshift bomb look like an infinitely imperfect tracing of… ourselves. An unsurpassed formula. The smell of burning coal will take this thought a long way. \n\nOkay, enough propaganda for today. I need a drink. But not too much, unfortunately. Tomorrow the "work" will be handed over..."

Only a petty man feeds on fear.\n\nDespite the lack of machinery and the need to rely on manual labor, we are on the right track to achieving prosperity.

They don't like us, of course, but they all want lit streets, hot water taps and a working industry. An attack on us would be costly and would result in a loss of supply. Besides, there would be no end to the wars to take control of the power plant. Everyone would like to own it, and this could lead to chaos and destruction of the facility. So we need to sit down at the table and talk. The Bełchatów Railway Station is bursting at the seams with all kinds of materials sent as payment for electricity. It is not known how long this condition will last, I hope as long as possible."
BBW_the_power_of_steam: "Moc pary"
BBW_the_power_of_steam_desc: "Although crucial, coal alone is not the only component of a healthy economy. Without steel, it is impossible to successfully extract it, fight other contenders for power or build houses in the place of ruins. Even though we do not have direct iron deposits, scrap metal around us is abundant. It is considered gross by some to recycle, but in fact it is a whole new production cycle. Our new American economics expert, Christian Paulson, believes so.\n\nAfter all, recycling is basically an individual activity, and here a large plant will be responsible for it. If its area formally covers all our dominion, then there will be no question of collecting garbage but only "using scattered warehouses of semi-finished materials"\n\nThat is why it was rightly recognized at the meeting of the Council that building a large steam scrap yard is a historic necessity. The Steam Combine "Citadel" will soon be operational. You can already see the smoke over Parzno, the blackest one can imagine.\n\nThousands of tons of steel each year ready to be turned into something useful..."
BBW_financial_surpluses: "Nadwyżki finansowe"
BBW_financial_surpluses_desc: "I am going to visit the grand opening of a new unit at the power plant in an hour. Thanks to the money from exports and skilful management, we managed to get the necessary materials. Soon, the narrow stream of energy flowing to the market will turn into a real Yangtze. Chances are our "trading partners" won't be able to resist it.\n\nMoreover, along with the new unit, new plants will be built and those for which there was no capacity before, will be reopened as well. It's wonderful to be rich. Everyone will admit it. And the more wealth the better. Hence the new Council decision to allocate a portion of the money directly to the people. In the end, they deserve it and the money released onto the market will come back to us anyway. As it always should be."

BBW_purchase_of_weapons_desc: "A secret associate of the Brotherhood has just arrived from Łódź. He brought great news about a new deal on the black market. Apparently, one of the smuggling groups got into the old military warehouse. Our associate got a suitcase filled with dollars, a souvenir bag full of dust, and quickly left. The delivery is expected to arrive within a few weeks. Our knights can't wait for something better than 10mm pistols to fall into their hands.

It will be a piece of cake to send them to work, and additional soldiers will always come in handy.

Knowing that they are nothing compared to the majestic effort of the human race, which is not afraid of breaking the snobbish conventions of beauty and "decency" - including the ones of climate. The only thing that matters is the strength that the sacred carbon energy brings us. And it is with her help that we will bring order to the North."

Moreover, it looks like anyone from entrepreneurs, workers in the funeral industry and even those working in private emergency services, seem to have power there. Much like our Brotherhood, although we are forced to make some economic interventions to stop decarbonization, ultimately the system that will reign in the world freed from green plague is to be based on the free market and private initiatives of free people, aware of the power of black energy, not constrained by Wiechowite propaganda.

BBW_warzecha_report_desc: "Our efforts at unifying the voivodeship’s power grid have turned out to be a farce! Previous reports of our Power Plant being able to sustain the entire region's power usage twofold ended up being just lies and overly optimistic propaganda, undoing months of development and years of future plans. To contain this crisis before it gets completely out of hand, I have tasked Paladin Warzecha with assessing the situation on the ground and figuring out who’s responsible for the falsified documents.\nOne thing is certain, however...\n§RHeads will roll for this§!."
BBW_SYSTEM_OVERLOAD_desc: "I haven’t seen riots this bad since the Trail of Three back in ‘27. This time, however, no matter how tempting the idea sounds, we can’t just blame them on Wiech. No, that would be too far of a stretch at this point. The masses would see through our deception and things would only get worse. I'm sure we'll find a use for this outburst once things have calmed down a bit, but for now, these protests have to be crushed. We need the people back in the mines, back in the factories, and back in their place! ...Or else this Blackout will never go away."
BBW_electricity_stamps_desc: "Rationing electricity... How low will we have to stoop to fix this shortage?\nI’ll need to jump through some pretty painful hoops to rationalize the introduction of stamp cards to the Paladins. After all, most among our upper echelons at the very least grew up when they were first around, creating lifelong resentment towards anything curbing their excess. This may lead to some uncomfortable comparisons, but this is the only solution I can think of that doesn’t require a whole cadre of professionals. Ones that we currently don’t have."
BBW_blow_up_lodz_desc: "The situation is dire and true recovery will take a long time, in the meantime, however, it would be prudent to take our eyes off the matters at hand and redirect our population’s sights toward other issues. Namely, the exclusion zone in Bałuty. Through carefully weaved rhetoric and some... rather large stretches of the imagination, responsibility for the radioactive wasteland can be pinned on the damned Wiechowszczyzna and the puppet masters of Europe in Berlin, stoking further resentment towards our enemies."
BBW_temporary_adepts_desc: "Our security forces are heavily understaffed, there are no questions to be had about that. Following Paladin Rzymkowski’s recommendation, I’ve greenlit a plan to use some of our less egregious dissidents to bolster the ranks of our Adepts. They’ll need some very thorough training to fully clear their minds of any green delusions potentially clouding their rational thinking, but there’s nothing that some strict discipline and punishment can’t achieve. In the coming weeks, they’ll learn more about Common Sense than they’ve done for all their lives thus far... whether they want it or not."
BBW_crisis_staff_desc: "As much as I hate to admit it, an emergency of this magnitude cannot be solved merely through words and preventative half-measures. This situation calls for a well-organized group of experts, led by someone we can fully trust. For that reason, I’ve made the decision to induce Paladin Wróblewski into our inner circle. From now on, he will be the watchful eye presiding over a think tank made up of our brightest scribes, tasked with mitigating the Blackout’s effects. God, I hope they can bring a swift end to this crisis."
BBW_war_for_younger_generations_desc: "Children are naive, there’s no way around it. Their impressionable, little minds are ever susceptible to the vile propaganda spewed by our enemies, muddling their sense of right and wrong. I can only fear what horrible lies they hear about our actions from such naysayers. We need to find a way to ensure that our youths know how to defend their morals and maintain their Common Sense. For that purpose, they will participate in extracurricular, vocational activities that will turn them into exemplary members of the Brotherhood. More difficult work will also be an option for those who really want to prove their worth. In exchange for better grades or some trinket payment, teens will be heavily incentivized to take up work in the mines or receive military training alongside our most loyal men."
BBW_carbonari_association_desc: "Every movement has a youth wing. Why should we be different? There is a well of untapped potential inside every teenager just waiting to be exploited. A recent personal project of mine, the Carbonari Association, will do just that. It will gather all our politically minded youths, putting their bright minds together to help propagate our ideals among their peers. Membership will be entirely voluntary, of course, but what proud parent wouldn’t want their child to be part of such an organization? With all that said, however, there is still one more issue left to be dealt with - the question of leadership. Given the group's nature, I feel I am left with only two options: Roksana Węgiel or Jakub Zgierski. Roksana's popularity would be great for PR, but on the other hand, Jakub's dedication to our ideals is basically unshaken.\n\nI'll really need to think this over, as this choice could prove crucial in determining the organization's direction."
BBW_take_whoever_you_can_desc: "There are hundreds of working-age men out there, pointlessly meandering about and being a dead weight on our economy. Even now, with almost daily power outages, they show no initiative in trying to fix the issue. Do they not know that the Blackout won’t just end by itself? Regardless of what they may think, we’ll need to give them a... helping hand in realizing what’s good for them and the Brotherhood at large. From now on, every person found to be unemployed or working jobs deemed unimportant to the Brotherhood’s goals will be subject to so-called Emergency Shifts at local mines, factories, power plants, and other areas in crucial need of staff. With the additional manpower, we should see our output improving in no time."
BBW_chop_whatever_you_can_desc: "The amount of coal unearthed in Bełchatów is simply not sufficient to maintain our overstrained power grid. While there are many more deposits beneath the Voivodeship’s soil, setting up new mining operations would prove far too costly given our limited resources and unstable situation. What we do have at our disposal, however, are plenty of working men and a wide array of axes and chainsaws to choose from. The conclusion is simple, of course - our workers, voluntary or not, will be sent to gather as much firewood as possible from the enormous forests spanning the region. While not the most efficient energy source out there, it should be enough to keep the power output stable for the moment, or at least so I’ve been told."
BBW_search_wherever_you_can_desc: "Thus far, the measures we’ve put in place to limit power waste have gone largely unenforced. Sure, there were some particularly egregious incidents that any person with even a smidge of Common Sense would spot, but things aren’t always so easy. Now that the Blackout is mostly a non-issue, it’s high time that we do some weeding and find all those who thought themselves too clever to be caught. Anyone suspected of rigging their electricity usage counters or possessing more fuel than they were allotted will face justice for sabotaging the Brotherhood.\n\nAdditionally, Paladin Janecki suggested that this could also serve as a great way for the Carbonari to prove themselves. Acting as our own eyes and ears on the ground, they’ll get rewarded for reporting anyone they think might be bending the rules.\n\ They might end up needing slightly sanitized explanations for what happens to those they turn over, however..."

If we don’t take the initiative in our battle against those green bastards, then we’re just inevitably setting ourselves up for failure. I’ll notify Paladin Rzymkowski that it’s time again to sweep out any eco-fascists that might be hiding amongst our working population.

Because of that, we must think twice before we dedicate ourselves to building truly impressive machines, like main battle tanks. I have thought twice, and I have decided against it, at least for now. I hope that one day we may achieve that as well, but for now, we must improvise, we must adapt, and we must overcome. And it seems to me we can only do that through the mass production of lighter armoured vehicles. They are much faster than tanks, and more importantly, much cheaper. This will allow us to back the coal cause with state-of-the-art armoured warfare without losing all of our funds on costly and sluggish tanks."
BBW_harder_is_better_desc: "As one of the leading figures of the brotherhood I am responsible for protecting my people.I believe that in the face of a severe threat we cannot hold back when it comes to strengthening our military might. When riding into battle, our brave soldiers must be accompanied by awe-inspiring steel beasts. I have thought about the best candidate to fill this role, and I did not have to think for a long time. When it comes to vehicles, one stands above them all as the king of mobile warfare - the heavy tank. Ever since World War 2 it has been the deciding factor of many-a-battle, and has always struck fear into the hearts of those in its way. The production of these killer machines will cost us greatly, but it is something I have deemed necessary to succeed. If you ask me, on our path we cannot afford to compromise. Our military must be the strongest in Poland."

It is now that I ask myself the question: why would we have them read anything else? I have learned my lessons from our humble beginnings and clash with the green league, and I know that any literature not sanctioned by the government carries the risk of poisoning the citizens' minds with propaganda and vile lies about the rightousness of the carbon cause.

belchatow.1.t: "Proces trzech"
belchatow.1.desc: "Sąd Bractwa, sala mieszcząca się w małym budynku skonfiskowanego centrum handlowego Estakada, pękał w szwach. „Proces trzech”, jak żywo pisała prasa o tym wydarzeniu, był na ustach wszystkich mieszkańców Bełchatowa od momentu ogłoszenia terminu rozprawy. W innych miastach ludzie z uwagą wsłuchiwali się w swoje CB-radia, a tam, gdzie jeszcze działał Internet, z niecierpliwością czekali na kolejne linijki stenogramu skrupulatnie pisanego przez jednego ze skrybów.\n\nPomimo protestów, niektórzy przynieśli do sądu oprawione w ramki zdjęcia ofiar ataku. To, co wydarzyło się na samej sali sądowej, można opisać jedynie jako czysty chaos. Pomimo instrukcji i gorączkowych interwencji strażników, tłum widzów nadal podnosił gniewne okrzyki w kierunku trzech niepozornych nastolatków. Dwóch z nich beznamiętnie wpatrywało się w biurko oskarżonego. Trzeci, najmłodszy, co chwila wpatrywał się agresywnie w stronę trybunału i gapiów, wywołując kolejne okrzyki i groźby. I tak to trwało przez kilka godzin, aż wszyscy, zwyczajnie zmęczeni procedurami, zaczęli słuchać oskarżeń.\n\n Przynajmniej do czasu, gdy głos zabrał główny prokurator - Wysoki Paladyn Tomasz Sommer. Wezwany przez trybunał, z trudem panował nad emocjami podczas odczytywania ustaleń komisji śledczej. n- „Oskarżeni działali w ramach zorganizowanej grupy przestępczej określającej się jako „Liga Obrońców Środowiska”, planując za pomocą terroru obalenienie aparatu państwowego i doprowadzenie do zmian społecznych w duchu źle zrozumiałej i radykalnej ochrony przyrody...”\nGdy po chwili usiadł na swoim miejscu, trybunał zmuszony był przerwać rozprawę i wyprowadzić oskarżonego oraz widzów. Ryk słowa „ŚMIERĆ!” rozbrzmiewający w murach audytorium był przytłaczający."

belchatow.2.t: "Bloody Saturday"
belchatow.2.desc: "11:39 - High Paladin Tomasz Sommer returns from his visit to The Power Plant and gets off with a guard from his service Opel Insignia in front of the Brotherhood's Headquarters, the former city hall. Suddenly a young woman approaches him briskly, the security staff is too slow to react. A shot is fired from a pistol. The girl was the daughter of one of the members of the guard. High Paladin Tomasz Sommer gets shot in the heart and is pronounced dead on his way to the hospital at 1:46 pm. The assassin was immediately apprehended. \n\n13:49 - Information about the attack spreads at an astonishing pace. Social outrage leads to crowds of people taking to the streets in solidarity with the Brotherhood. \n\n13:57 - After hearing about the attack on Sommer from a smuggled radio, prisoners lynch the accused from the "Trial of Three". The prison guards only react after a long while. Two of the inmates are killed, the third arrives in the prison infirmary severely wounded. At 2:23 am the next day he is escorted to hospital and put into an induced coma.\n\n 14:3 - A spontaneous demonstration reaches the headquarters of the Brotherhood. Several thousand people are demanding the assurance of security and immediate punishment for the guilty girl…"

belchatow.3.t: "Monument of Discord"
belchatow.3.desc: "Tadek, a newly minted adept of the Brotherhood, found out that he had been stationed at the ceremony of unveiling some monument the day before the event itself. He wasn’t very thrilled about it, because he had leave scheduled at that time and had plans to go out drinking with the other novices. "There is no way out, only you are available right now, I will not be recalling those dogs from outside the city" the voice of the Sergeant Knight thundered in his head. Oh well, I have to pull myself together, put a rifle on my shoulder, a plate on my chest and keep order on the steam tram going from Wola Mikorska to Steel Park - the former Olszewski Park, where the composition of sculptures that was the source of the problem was to stand.\n\nTadek didn't really care why they put it there, who they were supposed to be based off of, etc. They didn't pay him for being interested. But he could tell something was up in the air. In the tram, only the sounds of the boiler interrupted the deafening silence. The people dressed in black did not even look out of the windows at the landscape, which was shrouded by smog. Tadek was afraid to talk to anyone. Even the Chief Knight who looked like a good bloke.\n\nWhen they got there, everyone saw a huge, several meters tall… block. From a speech by some balding bighead, Tadek learned that the sculpture is dedicated to those who died in an attack from a few months ago and the newest victim of  "The Green Terror" - Head Paladin Sommer. The great cauldron in the center of the monument obscured the blue sky with thick, black clouds.\n\nThe young adept felt in his bones that people were clearly moved by the whole matter. They were silent until the very end, even during the ride back. In the evening, Tadek, already off duty, relaxed with the desired beer and thought…"

belchatow.4.t: "An Uneasy Council"
belchatow.4.desc: "The entire Brotherhood council, made up of a dozen or so people, was despite the late hour, debating the newly obtained evidence with incredible vigor. These were letters full of particularly disturbing information. Finally, the chaotic discussion gave way to order, when the Scribe Stefan Janecki slammed his fist down onto the table so hard that a pile of old rubber boots collapsed near the tiled stove in the corner of the room. The guards frantically began putting it back together.\n\n- Dear Brothers, I don't think we have any doubts that this green plague is stronger than anyone might have previously suspected. By our lack of attention, we raised a bunch of ingrates and dreamers who, through their stupidity, can bring us all doom. A generation of parasites…\n\nSenior Paladin Witold Gadomski - Head of the Ministry of Economy, immediately raised his hand.\n\n- Exactly so! We have failed, we have handed over the younger generation and some of the old to eco-terrorists and climate liars! How did Wiech's writings reach the people?! We've slept well for way too long and now we're going to bear the consequences. The attacks so far are only the beginning for certain and the "Wiechowszczyzna" awaits us. We must act quickly. Scribe Janecki's department is already preparing proscription lists.\n\nThe said Chief of Intelligence nodded knowingly.\n\n- - Excellent - replied Paladin Łukasz Warzecha, Head of the Infrastructure Department.\n- - Brothers, let us remember that many of our...fellow citizens are still faithful to good standards and if they found out what is really happening behind the scenes, they would support us with their body and soul. It would be good to use their enthusiasm.\n\nAfter a moment of silence, Paladin Łukasz continued -\n\n- - I think we have reached a consensus. Knight Krzysztof - announce the brown alarm. We are on the brink of a new era, and only a wretched group of green crooks is keeping us from embracing it.\n\nThe knight started throwing rubber boots into the tiled stove. After a while, brown smoke, discernible only to the eager eyes of the initiated brethren (it barely stood out against the gray-black sky), gave signal for a secret mobilization."

belchatow.5.t: "A Turbulent Work Day"
belchatow.5.desc: "Andrzej, Junior Knight of the Brotherhood, scratched his head in disbelief. It was already dawn and total darkness gave way to the gloom typical of Bełchatów. You could plainly see what happened during the night. Most of the windows were broken and shards of glass crunched under the feet of the dawdling passers-by. Each of them seemed to ignore the destruction. Rarely did anyone stop in front of the radiation signs painted in green paint. After a while, Andrzej himself began to look at them curiously.\n\nThese symbols were found only on those buildings that had their doors torn off their hinges. The bystanders seemed to be pleased with the effects of the night's "riots"\n\n- - - Knight Andrzej! Get your ass to work! I'm not a Scribe to cover yours for you! There is no time to enjoy the views.\n\n- But of course, Scribe Jakub, but of course...\n\nA small detachment entered one of the most devastated buildings - a small apartment block. Andrzej clenched his sweaty hands around his SMG RAK’s grip anxiously. His work day had begun...\n\n\n***\n\nList of Suspects. Entry No. 120.\n\nAddress - REDACTED\n\nReporting Officer - Junior Scribe Jakub W.\n\n“First apartment - married couple, suspected green media job before the Fall. The husband has 4 teeth knocked out and both legs broken. The wife has a black eye.\n\nSecond apartment - a family of five. Three teenagers included. Green literature found in the form of the book "Not all for the trash haul". The book was partially burnt. The youths were arrested for interrogation and rehabilitation purposes. The parents have been placed under supervision.\n\nThird apartment - Lonely man. A bum. He was performing prohibited recycling in the form of collecting cans for illegal trading in. Material evidence was confiscated. He resisted arrest and attacked the unit. He was intoxicated. Junior Knight Andrzej neutralized him with a burst from his Submachine Gun. Application for decoration sent to the council...""

belchatow.6.t: "Carbon Fever"
belchatow.6.desc: "The bus - an old, shabby Jelcz rocked mercilessly as it drove over the pothole littered road. Its passengers, mostly youths from nearby schools, either tried to fall asleep or were looking at the landscape shrouded by smog and the late hour’s dim light through the bus’ dirty windows.. A dozen or so of them, the members of a newly established class from one of the Bełchatów high schools, clearly differed from the rest. They were huddled and scared, just staring blankly at the floor beneath their feet.\n\nAfter a while the bus slowed down and finally stopped in front of a metal gate. The passengers spilled out at the sound of yelling hurrying them out. They were put in a single file line. Someone approached the freshmen with a submachine gun in his hand.\n\n- I am Knight Mateusz and from today you are to refer to me in this way. And you will tell me everything that I ask you about. Did I make myself clear?\n\n- Yes, sir! - answered the now-awakened freshmen\n\n- - Good, due to the increased demand for coal, you have been mobilized to work in the mines. Your absences from school will be excused. Maybe they will even raise your behavior marks. Your situation looks like this - 12 hours a day's work, and a half-hour break at 12:0. You will be allotted some food. To the changing room - MARCH!\n\n- Yes, sir - freshmen replied sluggishly, and went where they were shown."

belchatow.7.desc: "A small squad composed of a Scribe and two Knights moved from apartment building to apartment building and from house to house. Every selected person moments after hearing the knock on their door, was already traveling on the steam tram. There, they listened to the speeches of one of the Elder Knights or Junior Paladins about the need for immediate mobilization. The enemy is close, right outside our gates, and we must eradicate him.\n\nThe enemy is close, right outside our gates, and we must eradicate him. The tram then traveled across town to the training base in the village of Kanada. This place had the reputation of a terrible slaughterhouse, but the conscripts knew that without pain, they would not be able to ensure constant economic growth. Once they got out, they were immediately brutally restrained, shaved bald and stripped of their belongings. Then, naked, they landed in the initiation room where, using a piece of coal, symbols were drawn on their bodies that they had to swear on - A Mine, A Bolt of Lightning and the Black Steam. The fumes released by burning fine coal put them in an ecstatic mood. They felt strong, ready to fulfill their historical role. Their mission had just begun…"

belchatow.8.desc: "Elder Scribe Ziemkiewicz sat alone in the cafeteria. It was late, those who could were fast asleep, while those who had to were hard at work. However, the Brotherhood's media representative did not know what to do with himself.\n\nHe just unwittingly played with a fork stuck in a bowl of macaroni and cheese, mockingly known as spaghetti. He didn't know what to feel. Anger, fear, or maybe ... pride in the decisive nature of the organization to which he belonged. He was fresh from the last meeting of the Council. He knew what was about to happen. He knew what would happen in this city and on this earth. His hands started shaking. The thought of a nip of cognac hidden away in his Brotherhood robe (the council's latest idea) secretly flashed through his mind. He drank it all in one gulp. He calmed down. There is no way out. He must get to writing. Tomorrow's announcement needs to be ready. As well as those for all the following days…"

belchatow.9.desc: ""Dear Brothers," Scribe Janecki began - "enough has been said about what will happen next"\n\nScribe Rafał Ziemkiewicz, involuntarily stroked the spine of his new book. The cover was thick and pleasantly rigid to the touch. After the highly detailed, suggestive visualization of the atomic bomb explosion, it was very clear that he wasn't skimping out on the first impressions for the readers.\n\n"We're ready," said the Brotherhood's Chief of Intelligence as he grabbed Chief Scribe's book. Its cover showed a young man in a suit with a thick tangle of curly hair on his head. He flipped through it casually. Knowing its contents by heart, he was habitually looking for any inaccuracies. It was unnecessary, of course.\n\n"Paladin Rzymkowski", he said, without taking his eyes off the publication, "Get to it."Without a word, the Chief of the Brotherhood's forces stood to attention, saluted and marched out of the room. The members of the Brotherhood’s guards followed soon after him."

belchatow.10.desc: "§GJakub Wiech§!. Nazwisko to odbijało się gniewnym echem wszędzie tam, gdzie docierały wpływy Bractwa i gdzie rozprowadzano dwuczęściową książkę skryby Ziemkiewicza „Protokoły Krucjaty Atomowej”. Ludność nieustannie przeklinała tego szaleńca, który chciał odebrać im normalność. Wszakże organizacja terrorystyczna stworzona przez Wiecha planowała zniszczenie elektrowni i zbudowanie na jej miejscu niezwykle niebezpiecznego, odzyskanego reaktora jądrowego, prawdopodobnie jakiegoś RBMK z Ukrainy.\n\nŁącząc skrajny fundamentalizm religijny, etos zakonu rycerskiego i zielony fanatyzm atomowy, niemal zepchnęli ziemie Bractwa w mrok średniowiecza, oświetlany jedynie blaskiem morderczych odpadów radioaktywnych. Wisienką na torcie ich szaleństwa był samobójczy plan §GŚwiętej Zielonej Zemsty§! na Niemczech za budowę Nord Stream 2.\n\nTylko zdecydowana postawa egzekutorów Bractwa uchroniła nas przed tym strasznym losem. Ale macki „Wiechowszczyzny” sięgają głębiej, niż wcześniej zakładano. Atomowi Krzyżowcy są wśród nas i wśród naszych sąsiadów. Czekają tylko na moment słabości Bractwa, by uderzyć ponownie.

Instructions on how to segregate trash, how to save water, how to combine various plant-based foods in a diet to effectively eliminate meat from it.\n\nTwo young people were scurrying around the little office. The woman was operating the printer. The man sorted the individual leaflets into piles. It was late, and there was only one window letting in faint moonlight. Light bulbs were forbidden so as to not make the Brotherhood spies’ jobs easier. Suddenly, a barely audible murmur came from outside the door. The man stopped dead in his tracks and quickly pulled the gun out from his belt\n\nSeeing this, the woman began to pour spirit over the entire printing apparatus. In an instant, the door blew up. Smoke rose all around. Sounds of gunfire and the steps of heavy boots flooded the room. The man was hit in the chest by a series of shots. He fell down cold between the pages, staining them with blood. The woman did not manage to pull the lighter out of her pockets as she was butt-stroked over the head. She fell to the ground,  was quickly handcuffed and taken outside. Inside the operational commander, with all the willpower available to him, kept himself from lighting a cigarette. He couldn't leave until he had his paperwork done. There was no time. By tomorrow, this action had to be finished."

Suddenly, Brotherhood soldiers entered the room without knocking. All armed and armored. The teacher ordered the students to stand at attention. The commander of the newly arrived unit spoke. However, instead of talking to the students, he ordered his subordinates to search them. Crushed against their benches, they were silent as their backpacks and pockets were rummaged. Marijuana was quickly found - a green, unprocessed drug, and leaflets informing about the advantages of renewable energy over coal-based energy. All students, including those with no forbidden items, were transported to the Mine on the same day. There they were told that they had been sentenced to a month of community service. Shovels were handed out and put to work at gunpoint.\n\n\n "Hear you young one, listen nicely,\nAnd you’ll live life so precisely,\nYour own happiness you’ll come by,""

Now, calmly, in her house in the suburbs of Bełchatów, she was drinking her evening tea. Thanks to having a good job, she could afford a beautiful, one-story house with a fireplace in the living room. She liked to sit on the couch to the sound of sizzling wood or coal and drink delicious tea. And sometimes even spiked tea. And so she did this time. A 100ml shot of "Brunatna" mixed with a decoction of nettles and sage. Elizabeth treated herself to a wonderful evening.\n\n Suddenly, around 10 p.m., the fire in the fireplace suddenly went out. “Tired” Ela struggled to get up from the soft armchair and bent over the barely burning coals. After a short while, she noticed something long and gray among the ashes. She did not even have time to scream when the mysterious object flashed bright light with the deafening sound. Black-clad Brotherhood members burst into the house. They handcuffed the stunned Ela and began to brutally search the apartment. The book "Gardener's Guide" was quickly found. The commanding officer considered the description of sunflower cultivation to be disguised propaganda about the propagation of solar energy. Material evidence was confiscated and Elżbieta, suspected of betraying the ideals of the Brotherhood, was taken by the Black Paladins"

The traces of fighting have not yet been removed, only one track at the Widzew station was passable. The rest were blown up. The blackened blocks of the nearby estate were marked with traces of artillery fire. After a short stop for the identification of passengers, the train continued, via Niciarniana towards Fabryczna.\n\n TThe beautiful station building miraculously survived the war, although in many places the glass roof was full of holes from bullets and explosions. The inhabitants of Łódź, recruited for work, were just cleaning shards of glass from the floor. The students were rushed by the guards onto the tram. The poorly installed boiler filled the first passenger car with smoke, while some seeped out to the surrounding cars. All that could be heard was coughing and heavy breathing drowned out by the sound of the locomotive. After the mercilessly long ride, the tram stopped next to the former Manufaktura. Stretching further was only nuclear wasteland of Bałuty. The makeshift fence made of mesh and hollow bricks could not cover the gray-green sea of rubble. Then an agitator - a scribe of the Brotherhood - entered the rostrum by the fence.\n\n- Take a look. This is the result of the lies that green fascists, leftists and other lunatics have been pouring into your head. Here lies the culmination of all false progress - Total Atomic Annihilation!\n\nLet me just remind you - it is thanks to coal that you are here, it gives us real, stable power. Thanks to it, we will be able to rebuild the city. And it is thanks to it that we will rid this glowing, green stain off the surface of the Earth!"

belchatow.15.t: "To Celebrate or not to Celebrate?"
belchatow.15.desc: "Members of the Brotherhood Council were in a great mood. Everything that could be achieved at this point has been achieved. However, they did not celebrate. They rested. Tobacco smoke was floating around in the conference room, bottles of "Brunatna" were scattered about. Ah, "Brunatna''. Innovative alcohol made of sugar and a small hint of coal had an enormous kick to it. Scribe Ziemkiewicz was spread out on three linked chairs languishing. Scribe Janecki, with a cigarette in his mouth, looked at the portrait of Tomasz Sommer hanging on the wall.\n\nPaladins Warzecha and Gadomski talked about the superiority of diesel without a catalyst and with a resistor mounted on the pump over a gasoline engine. Paladin Rzymkowski was cleaning his pistol on the conference table. Suddenly there was a knock on the door. Paladin Rzymkowski ordered the person to come in. A trembling Adept, one of Ziemkiewicz’s subordinates, ran inside. The high Scribe, seeing him, got up with a groan and sat down on one of the chairs.\n\nThe Adept handed him a piece of paper that looked to be some kind of report. Holding his head up with one hand, Ziemkiewicz grabbed the letter and started reading. With each passing second, the blurry eyes regained their focus. His hand dropped from his head. His mouth opened wide and his gaze went to the other council members, increasingly disoriented by his facial expressions. Shocked, he only said…"

belchatow.16.t: "The Rehabilitation Draft Succeeds!"
belchatow.16.desc: "Ever since Piotrków had fallen to the Brotherhood, deafening silence in both the streets and homes soon followed. Almost every Hooligan had already been captured, or was smart enough to blend in with the local population or hide out in the nearby forests. However, the typical hogwash of Brotherhood propaganda and the distinctly rosey daily news were supposed to be replaced with a “Special Interview” today. A young, 20 or so year old man began talking shortly after a shortened version of the news.\n\n“At the start, I was just a fan of the Club, then I was a believer... a fanatic. I was tempted and manipulated by a man claiming to be a prophet. I was convinced that the only path towards a good future was prayer, football matches and returning to the Red Plague of days long gone. However the Brotherhood cured my blindness, I see now how backwards and obscene those views were. That is why I’m calling all of you, my comrades, to lay down your arms and sign up for the Rehabilitation Draft. Thank you for your attention.”\n\nAnd with those words, the transmission went silent, though in the coming days, it’s almost certain that more testimonies from those changed for the better."

belchatow.17.desc: "- We were gracious. We were merciful. No more. Seeing the potential in the power of hooligans, we wanted to incorporate them into the structures of the army. But they only repaid us with rebellion! A NATIONAL TREASON! JUDASES! PHARISEES! THOSE INSTIGATORS, MOSTLY JEWS - THEY ARE TURNING PEOPLE AGAINST US! IT'S LITERALLY JUDEOCOMMUNISM!!! - thundered Marcin Rola on one of his pathostreams.\n\nRecently, the Brotherhood's media circulated photos of burning military recruitment commissions and riots in the largest cities of the conquered territories, mainly in Tomaszów Mazowiecki, Piotrków Trybunalski and Opoczno. The fans, led by former Red Army officers, took to the streets in protest against Elder Paladin Rzymkowski's proposal to try to recruit the Widzewiaks as auxillaries.\n\nAccompanied by screams and yells brimming with profanities, the most important of which are: "Starszy, matole! Twój rząd obalą kibole!" which literally translates as "Elder, you oaf! Your Brotherhood will be overthrown by hooligans".\nOne could only respond to such speeches with fire and smoke. Our response will need to be swift and brutal. We need to bring down their remaining Chimneys of the Covenant, rally all ex-officers, especially those Urbanites, and sentence them to such penalties that they will never see sunlight again."

belchatow.18.desc: "Management of the companies included in the Krośniewice Consortium decided to agree to a merger with the Brotherhood of Coal. At an extraordinary meeting of the board of directors, which lasted almost a whole day, all options were discussed in depth.\n\nEbrantil and his entire Paramedics faction were categorically against any merger, Rutkowski was in favor, and Skrzydlewski hesitated. Considering all the pros and cons, they came to an agreement with our delegation. All economic entities of the Consortium will retain their market position, autonomy on the incorporated territories and the possibility of development in the new state on equal terms. Only then these written assurances finally convinced Skrzydlewski to tip the scales and sign the merger document.\n\nThe amalgamation of the two largest economic powers in the region outside the capital is definitely a game changer, and possibly the final decisive stage for the Brotherhood's hegemony over the other warlords. Now nobody will stand in the way of Poland's industrial revival!"
belchatow.18.a: "Hurrah for a United Future!"

belchatow.19.t: "The Triumvirate Votes Against Unification!"
belchatow.19.desc: "This morning, around 8 a.m., an envoy from the Consortium arrived to present the position of the Clique within our proposed unification at an extraordinary meeting of the Brotherhood’s Council.\nSome of the Paladins were really optimistic that a sovereign country would simply forsake its sovereignty in favor of our nation, however powerful it might be. Whether it was out of fear or caution, they believed that this was what would cause Skrzydlewski to bow down.\n\nUnfortunately, they were cruelly wrong.\n\nOur intelligence services, a few weeks before the negotiations, reported on the growing sentiment among  Krośniewice’s elites towards us. But apparently political considerations did not apply here, only the tangible economic gain mattered. Ultimately, they correctly recognized that submission to the authority of the Brotherhood would mean the end of their economic freedom and strict regulations including the commencement of a program of central planning that would follow.\n\nTheir refusal was categorical and clear. Any attempt to interfere with the economic, or any other form of independence of the Consortium will result in immediate retaliation using any means necessary, and they will not hesitate to use whatever means are available to repel the invader. If the rumors of Ebrantil's miracle weapons are true, it is likely that his inventions ultimately led Skrzydlewski to make this bold but ultimately stupid decision."

belchatow.20.desc: "To kickstart our plan of mitigating industrial losses we need coal, coal and once again coal. This necessary resource is used to power up our cities, our factories and is instrumental in creating certain materials like steel. Our Industrial Planners know that too, and they’re asking us for increased production of the "Black Gold"."

belchatow.21.desc: "Bełchatów. Our own Pearl of progress lies in the vast sea of decline. It's a truly remarkable city, upgraded by us to its greatest extent thus far. Constantly bustling with new factories, speeding cars, people walking back and forth, but it's also known for one thing, no other city in this god forsaken country can provide. This thing is constant, unending progress. Every day new factories are being built, new industrial zones planned and another family finds their new home. It's all beautiful and remarkable in its own right, but as all good things this one also hangs on the brink of an end. If we do not refurbish or build new, critical city infrastructure, it's doomed to hit the glass ceiling of industrial progress. City officials know that and demanded that we divert our resources to achieve this arduous task."

belchatow.22.desc: "It's been a while since we announced the project of rapid growth for our industrial efficiency, aimed at combating the decline that is perpetrated by these ungrateful eco-terrorists. Almost all of our nation and government has worked for it, experiencing many austerities and challenges. All of it makes it especially important, as failure to meet these expectations will create voices of doubt both public and in the party itself. It's a task we mustn't fail on, not this time and not ever again."
belchatow.22.a: "The final test to find out, if our project works."

belchatow.23.t: "Arising Problem"
belchatow.23.desc: "It hasn’t gone without our notice that our industrial output has shown signs of a slowdown or, even outright decline. It's not much, in fact it's possibly a simple growth fluctuation, prevalent in every rising economy. Yet it was enough for these "experts" to accuse us of spearheading ecosystem destruction and our death with it, blah, blah, blah. Of course these lies haven't gone unnoticed, both by other terrorists and our security forces which quickly took matters into their own hands. Truth is, that all of it is the fault of these eco-fascists who refuse to work with us for a better future, instead constantly trying to hamper the march of  civilization. There is only one solution. Increased Mass Industrialization! Of course such a move will stretch our resources dangerously thin, creating many new problems and before unheard of demands, which finding a solution for will be a priority if we want to further our might, but we’ve already been in worse situations, so surely we will deal with whatever road bumps await us and arise yet again, victorious."

belchatow.24.desc: "Aleksander był prostym człowiekiem. Tak prostym, że kiedy nastąpił upadek, prawie nic nie stracił. Takie są korzyści człowieka mieszkającego w jednym miejscu, utrzymującego się wyłącznie z pracy własnych mięśni i niewielkiego pola, które te mięśnie uprawiają. Tak miało wyglądać jego życie od początku do końca, przynajmniej tak mu się wydawało. Wszystko zmieniło się w jednej chwili, gdy korporacja Bractwa postanowiła wybudować fabrykę farb niedaleko wioski Aleksandra. To i propaganda Bractwa, by odrzucić „Kajdany Natury” i osiągnąć „Pełny potencjał Ludzkości”, sprawiły, że Alek poczył jedną emocję, której nigdy nie czuł w swoim życiu, tą emocją była Ambicja.\n\nNie trwało długo, zanim znalazł tam pracę, podobnie jak setki innych ludzi takich jak on, którzy wcześniej byli znacznie bliżej wegetacji niż prawdziwego życia. Połączenie jego umiejętności majsterkowania z nowo odkrytą ambicją sprawiło, że stał się jednym z głównych inżynierów, którym powierzono utrzymanie maszyn fabrycznych w jak najlepszym stanie. To wszystko całkowicie zmieniło jego życie Aleksandra, jego stary dom przeszedł bardzo potrzebny remont, jego żona dostała nową i piękną biżuterię, jego syn otrzymał możliwość studiowania w Bełchatowie w Państwowym Instytucie Energetyki i Górnictwa, a on sam codziennie jeździł do praca w nowym volkswagenie, świeżo przemyconym z Niemiec. Życie było dobre.\n\nZbyt dobre, by być tylko dobre. Jak wszystko na tym świecie, nie obyło się bez ceny. Alek po raz pierwszy zauważył, że coś jest nie tak niedługo po wybudowaniu fabryki, w tym czasie pobliska rzeka, która zawsze była jaskrawo niebieska, teraz codziennie zmieniała kolor, o dziwo na dokładnie taki sam kolor jak farba, która jest produkowana dzisiaj. Wraz z czasem sytuacja tylko się pogorszyła, chmury zaczęły ciemnieć, ptaki i zwierzęta chorowały lub znajdowano je martwe, pewnego razu Alek odkrył, że jego zaniedbane pole dało mu partię fioletowych ziemniaków. To wszystko było dziwne, nienaturalne, ale czy to było aż tak zaskakujące, jak on sam odrzucił naturę w pogoni za swoimi Ambicjami? Z pewnością nie było to zaskoczeniem dla Bractwa, które zawsze reagowało na te wydarzenia jako „doskonały przykład ekoterroryzmu”, lub jako bezpodstawną farsę stworzoną przez poszukiwaczy uwagi. Aleksander wiedział na pewno tylko jedno, że to nie koniec, a początek zmian, które rozleją się po całym kraju, przemieniając go nie do poznania, czy to na lepszy, czy na §Rgorsze...§!"

This won't be cheap or easy but if we want to be victorious in these ensuing days, we have to accomplish this hard task. If somehow we weren't able to complete the construction of said industry, we could always achieve similar results just by taking over whatever our enemies managed to put together. We would have to do this quickly though, as a continued lack of these capabilities will severely tarnish our war effort."

This was where the delegation of the Free City of Łódź was headed to negotiate an economic treaty between Łódź and the Brotherhood. They have a lot of problems, and energy is crucial for them, so it may turn out that we will be able to put a lot of pressure on them, because nowhere else in the region they will find an electricity supplier.\n\n- Hurry up! Clean up this shit, goddamn it! When the dialogites arrive, it is supposed to shine here! And if even one of these beggars shows up here, your heads will roll! - Discipline officer shouted to his subordinates.\n\nThe delegation arrived at the Ksawerowski Palace delighted with the clean streets and industrial plants where combustion was reduced for the duration of the negotiations, but the officials did not know what was hidden behind the corners of the carefully prepared route. Each visible element has been prepared in such a way as to make the greatest impression of a powerful, developing country.\n\nThe head of the delegation, Marek Belka, was pleased. And very conciliatory. He agreed to pay practically double the standard kilowatt-hour rate. Or they were just very desperate because they agreed without batting an eye on everything we pressed them. It's not a good sign when the other party doesn't even try to negotiate. But money is money. Gadomski returned triumphant with the Treaty of Ksawerów signed, and the whole Brotherhood council was overjoyed with prospects of Łódź opening their markets for our industrialists."

Przypadkowy przechodzień mógłby sobie pomyśleć, że jest on biednym, starym prykiem, którego płuca wypełnione są smogiem wypluwanym przez pobliską elektrownię. Mieszkańcy ulic jednak dobrze wiedzą, że to właśnie smog napędza tego starego człowieka. \n\nNiewielu bardziej zasłużyło się Bractwu niż jego starszy i pierwszy skryba. Gdy kraj pogrążył się w chaosie, Ziemkiewicz zjednoczył ludzi wokół ideałów przywrócenia normalności i przetrwania, wykorzystując energię z węgla i silny porządek hierarchiczny. To znany pisarz, jego książki stały się podstawą ideologiczną Bractwa i wizją lepszej przyszłości - opartej na brutalnych interesach i walce z dyktatem zielonego faszyzmu narzuconą przez UE. Choć jego przywództwo jest w dużej mierze symboliczne, jest jednak najbardziej szanowaną osobą w bractwie. \n\nDumnie obserwując czarne chmury zza zakurzonych tafli szkła, z jednego z wielu placów przemysłowych zbudowanych przez Bractwo, Ziemkiewicz jest piekielnie zdeterminowany, by szerzyć stary, dobry, zdrowy rozsądek w całym państwie. Ma do tego swoje fabryki (aby produkować broń), swoją zmotoryzowaną armię (aby nieść postęp zacofanym lewakom), swoje książki (aby napędzać serca i umysły ludzi) i swoje palce (aby ze złością tweetować). To powiedziawszy... \n\nW głowie Ziemkiewicza powoli zaczęły pojawiać się wątpliwości. „Czy to na pewno właściwy sposób postępowania?” „Czy to, co robimy *kaszle* jest naprawdę słuszne?” „Coraz więcej i więcej raportów *kaszle* o problemach z oddychaniem i zatrutych ziemiach dociera do naszych biur, i-” Nie. Wystarczy. Bez PRAWDZIWEGO, napędzanego ropą i węglem przemysłu, Polska byłaby niczym. Nie byłoby produkcji, prądu, samochodów, pracy - żylibyśmy jak na średniowiecznym zadupiu. Jesteśmy Bractwem. Kierujemy się zdrowym rozsądkiem. Nasze słowa są poparte śmiercionośną bronią i gigantyczną produkcją. To my mamy racje i zwyciężymy. \n\n*kaszle*"

While Warzecha himself is a great proponent of motorization and the usage of fossil fuels, his plans have thus far largely been hindered by the massive fuel deficit that followed the Fall. Together with his followers, he was one of the first to heed Ziemkiewicz’s call to action, and his supply of trucks and SUVs proved essential to securing the Bełchatów region.§!"

He created a system of indoctrinating new recruits, hailing them as defenders of common sense, fighting back against the Green Scourge. Later, he worked as the Black Curator, re-carbonizing the core curriculum in schools to stop the environmentalist corruption of the youth.

Yet, he has since proven his dedication to the cause tenfold, making use of his understanding of economic organization to assemble an entire financial system practically from scratch. Despite his deeply neoliberal beliefs, Gadowski accepts the usage of interventionist methods as necessary to ensure the final victory of the Brotherhood and its values.§!"

His fierce attacks on the Scouts, Hooligans, and the Dialogue followers often ended with bloody but successful results, bringing glory to our regime.
