POLITICS_RED_RABBI_DESC:0 "If you asked any Widzewiak in 2025 what his stance on Jewry is, he'd likely respond with the most brutal, antisemitic accusations one could think of. Had the Siege of Widzew not happened, he'd likely say the same things nowadays. \n\nThe ringleader of Widzew's hooligans, nowadays referred to as ''Rabin'' by his men, already partook in religious matters in his early childhood, but it wasn't until his late teenagehood when he started feeling a *real* religious calling. Serving as an altar boy and going through ever more extensive religious education in his primary and middle school, Rabin was what every Catholic Pole should strive to be - a man who's well versed in Bible and manual work, who adheres to Polish, conservative values and leads his fellow Widzew ultras in street fights. As all self-respecting Widzew ultras at the time, he was also highly antisemitic - this was due to the common jokes amongst Widzew's rival clubs that its members are the descendants of the Łódź Jewry living in Widzew that got exterminated during the Second World War. These animosities amongst football ultras in Łódź only grew during Poland's election fraud crisis and the subsequent fall of the nation - the remains of Widzew Jewry - mostly socialist in ideology - were an obvious target to blame, and as the state apparatus lost all power - frontier justice became the main judicial system of the country. \n\nAnd ŁKS was more than happy to capitalize on this. \n\nWith the city falling into complete chaos, the club's fans organized themselves into a makeshift army to deal with the commies, Jews and their own rivals once and for all. Six months later, Widzew still stood undefeated. Having to cooperate in order to survive, the district's defense orchiestrated by the Jewry turned out to be impossible for ŁKS to break through. As the attackers' lines faultered, a vicious counterattack commenced, in which ŁKS POWs were taunted by Widzew ultras mockingly converting to Judaism before executing them. Afterwards, the alliance prevailed, and although Widzewiaks were far from true, well-read Jews, their connection and dependence on them grew as the communist elites with Jerzy Urban at helm created a state for them and their new hooligan henchmen, of which Rabin was made the leader and lawspeaker of. \n\nNow, him and his boys are as lacking in subtelty as in foreskins. Their club scarves have been outfitted with golden Stars of David, and whenever they train volleys, they sing Jewish piyyutim. \nWhenever they go, whoever they fight, Widzew's club hymn echoes far."

#########################WYCIĘTE Z OPISU RABINA, MOŻE DA SIĘ NA COŚ PRZEROBIĆ I WYKORZYSTAĆ.  
#This wasn't mere streetfighting - the ŁKS army blocked the Widzew District from the outside world, sieging it down and attempting everything they could to kill off the Widzewiaks and their Jewish neighbours - from bombarding their opponents with rocks and Molotov cocktails to sabotaging the city's power grid, water sistem and sewerage. Cut off from food and basic amenities, there was no other way for Widzew than to cooperate, and given the football ultras'...  *limited brain power*, the Jewry took the helm in organising the city district's defenses. Food and water were rationed, makeshift fortifications and latrines were installed, weapons were distributed, and so - time passed. \n\nDays. Weeks. Months of bombardment. And yet - getting with rocks and Molotovs, shitting in makeshift latrines, defending against ŁKS assaults and having to ration almost rotting food and water - Widzew withstood. After this much time, the connection between the football ultras and Jews became real, and ŁKS' morale completely faltered after half a year spent on failing to break through. of their football nemesis and the Jews.

POLITICS_JERZY_URBAN_DESC:0 "A man born during the turbulent times for Jews in Poland forced into hiding along with his family is yet again facing turbulent times, though this time for all his countrymen alike. He didn't receive proper education until the end of the Second World War, even then he has never graduated from any University. Despite those obstacles, he quickly began to write for state-controlled newspapers, often harshly criticizing the government's policies. Eventually, he became a spokesperson for the communist government in 1981. Being responsible for propaganda during the infamous rule of General Jaruzelski, he became known as the "Goebbels of the Martial Law era". After the fall of communism, he became a member of Polish social democratic parties (SdRP and SLD), a famous internet personality popular among the youth and a successful stock trader, becoming the 98th most wealthy Pole in 2004. An experienced propagandist and political intriguer, he managed to survive in the third collapse of the Polish state. After the political situation in Łódź had clarified, he was invited to create a government with the Hooligans of Widzew, who were desperate to find competent Jews for their ruling structure."

ZYD_constant_brawls_desc:0 "It would be an understatement to say that our lands are boiling with unrest. Widzewians wander between communes and places where suckers are mugged, they start fights (often with fatal casualties), they plunder everything that is not bolted down to the ground. Meanwhile, in the woods lurk the ŁKS militias who came here banished from Łódź by the Lord of Dialogue. Lonely wanderers often vanish without a trace. No one is sure of the future, and conflict grows between First and Second Arrivals as to how to overcome the crisis."

ZYD_the_decalogue_upgrade_desc:0 "Yahweh Himself has visited our most pious men tonight in a dream. They claim that He ordered them to amend the Decalogue immediately and to extend it significantly. After a short analysis, it can be seen that the proposed changes will seriously increase the rigor to which the citizens of Widzew will be subjected. There is also an emphasis on obedience to Yahweh, Elders, Prophets of Faith and the Rabbi. The Second Arrivals are protesting against the appropriation of secular law competences by religious law. However, it cannot be denied that such an extensive Decalogue could become a guarantee of peace, unity and unanimity amongst the Chosen People if it were to be implemented as law."

The Hooligan Communes of Widzew, independent of anything, are habitats of moral decay and are the source of endless class divides and outright antagonism among them. A functioning state cannot be built on this basis. While we can... respect the distinctiveness of individual tribes in the cultural sense of the word, their legal independence from the central government must be abolished."

ZYD_alcohol_rationing_desc:0 "One of the most pressing problems affecting our land is alcoholism. Although, according to the decalogue, we cannot refuse any beer from suckers, it causes huge problems with the organization and morale of our warriors. They do not know moderation and are not able to go about their duties for most of the time. There are even rumors that the losers deliberately supply them with alcohol so that Widzewiaks wouldn't be able to rob them. Something has to be done about it. The first arrivals proposed to extend the Decalogue even further - by imposing the obligation to consume kosher beer, distributed directly by rabbis and establishing non-alcoholic holidays such as Passover, we will manage to reduce this problem."

How are we to maintain the enthusiasm of the Twelve Tribes if their most important representation, their highest source of inspiration, is not able to score a goal playing against a team of perpetually drunk loiterers? Anyways, frankly speaking, it would be difficult to distinguish the two anyway...

Of course, these talented players won't come to us for free, but it's a game worth playing. In addition to having a real dream team, thanks to them, we will emphasize the religious unity and acceptance of the Chosen People and encourage our foreign brothers to support our effort to release the Philistines and Ammonites from other clubs.

Although the appointment of suckers to the RTS eleven may come as a kind of shock to members of the Twelve Tribes, and it is likely that there will be much anxiety about such a decision. However, Second Arrivals, along with the Kibic, will emphasize that it will improve our opinion among the losers themselves and thus increase the efficiency of their work.

Of course, they do not work and collect funds from suckers, that is, those who have employment. In theory, it was supposed to allow them to learn hand-to-hand combat, study Torah and pray for the Club and the Nation. This system can no longer be maintained - our army is a drunken, parasitic mob who can neither hold a bat straight nor quote even a half-line of the Book of Numbers.

While at the beginning we managed to keep them in check, now strikes and unrest are increasing mainly due to the growing greed of the Warriors of Israel. Of course, this has had a terrible effect on our industrial production. We can't beat the pagans or ŁKS with slingshots and broken baseball bats. We have to do something about it."

Under a certain religious regime, our warriors would begin to cultivate the land and initially perform simple craftsmanship. That way, we would give them a tangible job, increase production, and we could calm the mood among suckers. Engrossed in work and prayer, hooligans will not have time or will to mug. However, it will be difficult to force them to do so, most of them do not have a trade in their hands, let alone in their legs and heads. Religious and vocational education will take a while."

A few nice words, a short "political and religious" training session and there will be peace among the losers and Widzew will finally serve us.

ZYD_usury_as_an_alternative_to_robbery_desc:0 "Although tradition-honored robbery is an integral part of the ethos of Widzew's people, maintaining this state causes various complications - it is difficult to control the economy when every plan is countered by arbitrary actions of Yahweh's warriors. Our scholars of faith, after many days of studying the sacred texts and in cooperation with the Second visitors from Kibic's sign, have found a solution to this problem. Usury given to suckers, as a financial operation, by its nature is a constant and predictable factor, and in certain, appropriate interpretations it could be synonymous with robbery. A short course in Jewish economics will make it clear to the audience that this is much more profitable than simple robberies."

They are godless Jebusites who graduated from Pabianice, who let gingers pass forward in queues. Savages who lick plates after rolls and confuse Reksio with Krecik.

Each day's fiery sermons and imaginative parables teach us about the power of the Renewed Covenant and those who are not worthy of it. After the speeches there is a period of intense physical training during which psalms are sung.

For the sake of fame, power over other people and to prove their mettle, they are able to do things that no one else would dare to do. They are second to none in their bravado on the battlefield. Some radical rabbis feel that they are subconsciously proud of their covenant with Yahweh, of the grace He has bestowed upon them.

They wear steel breastplates made of scrap metal, they make shields from it, which they polish in such a way that the sunlight reflecting on them blinds their enemies. They excel in the use of slingshots and captured rifles. All this takes place under the supervision of rabbis, to the sounds of songs written by King David, to the light of the menorah and the sounds of Widzew’s football matches. Even our starting eleven put on sandals and tunics with the logo of the Chosen Club and the Star of David. Today we are like our Second King - inconspicuous, but ready to defeat any Goliath that stands in our way. We too are ready to restore the lost glory to the Chosen People. It is our divine duty."

The Rabbi, however, with a stone-cold face, awaits whatever the future will bring. Hopefully Yahweh will be gracious."

ZYD_sanhedryn_desc:0 "Rabbi came down from the chimney a changed man. He doesn't eat or drink, he hasn't said a single word for days. Many of us have already begun to worry, not knowing what this might mean. Today, however, he shouted that the council of the Elders was to gather immediately without taking his eyes off the sky. He has something important to relay to them."

Even though there were no clouds, the rain fell crimson. People picking it up in rain barrels discovered that it was Kadarka. White dust appeared on the ground next to the blades of grass. Sniffing it, Widzewiaks felt a huge surge of strength. The rust started to peel off spontaneously from the Ark of the Covenant, and from under it, untouched by time, its smooth, immaculate bodywork emerged. At the border of our state, lightning began to strike our enemies’ territory, lighting fires as far as the eye could see. Rabbi, despite the fact that a powerful wind had risen in Tomaszów, has climbed the chimney again, holding the Banner of the Covenant and the original bat in his hands. His voice carries over the wind’s terrible, bellowing, rumbling laughter. The first and second arrivals, Widzewiaks and losers, all gather in amazement at the of Tower Communion. Everyone is waiting for the words of Rabbi..."

Relative order prevails only in the vicinity of the railway station, where mixed Workers-Widzewiaks militias are putting an end to similar riots. From time to time, an Opel Insignia and Mercedes W124 converted into limousines drives up to the station' building. They are carrying gentlemen in cream suits, that rush immediately towards the station, where Comrade Kibic ordered to assemble the Central Committee of the Polish-Jewish Workers' Party.

He understands perfectly well that the free market can be not only a source of huge income, but also extraordinary thrills. At one point in his life, he forced himself to invest in Ford. But unlike many other home-grown Rockefellers, he wasn't concerned with competition. He knew he was second to none. After all, no one can win against the vanguard of the proletariat. And this is what the capitalists of Krośniewice must realize."

Hence, he had the pleasure of getting acquainted with the cutting words of another native of Łódź. And here was the dilemma. How does one treat that state, that monarchy nonetheless, born of pastiche and satire on the mass hysteria surrounding Jara Śmietana, Hoży Swarog and Krase Tylne Lico Płotki? Kibic thought, pondered and after a while he knew it - as a joke. And he sent his army to the border."

Our Home, Our Canaan, can already be seen looming over the horizon. Great Łódź. Great Widzew. The Homeland of Labor. The Homeland of our people. Even the toughest, most stoic of us are not able to hide our emotions. Not when they believed that they would be able to walk again in the shadow of the Tenements. Our Tenements."

ZYD_allija_desc:0 "We won. We got back the Promised Land. Our own Eretz Yisrael. The most important of mitzvot in the whole Halakha. To live in the Promised Land. The Old Widzew. Finally we got our Yom HaAliyah. At that point, even the strongest of us cried the tears of happiness. So the redeemed of the Lord have returned, and they came to Łódź with song, and with everlasting joy on their heads, gladness and joy overtook them, sorrow and sighing have fled."

zydzew.1.desc:0 "Yahweh looked at Canaan of the North and said:\n- "Great are the crimes of the nation with whom I once estabilished a covenant. The dust fell on the old trophies, the last witnesses of the former glory."\n\nYahweh then looked at New Jerusalem and said:\n- "Great is the corruption which has struck the chosen land. Green paper and gold calves are worshiped in my place. Jerusalem became a Sodom. The Israelites of the Widzew family fraternize with the loser Jebusites of the Śródmieście family. My people have forgotten the terms of the covenant. They eat from one bowl, and drink from one can as one, with those who do not know my name. There is not one righteous among them."\n\nThen Yahweh looked at the chiefs of the Widzew house and said:\n- "Where are the rulers of old who praised my name? Where is the Word left pure, free from lies and greed? They sold themselves. There is not one righteous among them."\n\nThen he looked at the warriors of Yahweh.\n- "Great is the weakness of my people. No one of its members is in the front line of Widzew's warriors. And eleven there I see unworthy strangers, eleven enemies of the tribe with whom I made a covenant. In gold they only believe. In gold and nothing more. There is not one righteous among them."\n\nGreat was Yahweh's anger. He said then:\n- “I say: It will be seven days and seven nights before the rain of flames falls on the new Sodom, once called My land. If a righteous man remains there, let him save those who can be saved and go south. Into wilderness. They will save the righteous, and they will suffocate sinners."\n\nRabbi lived then in Lodz, the last faithful servant of Yahweh. The sins of the chosen people did not drown out their faith in the victory of the Chosen Club and the Almighty Lord. For six days and six nights, he walked the streets of Łódź carrying the red flag, the symbol of the Covenant. On the seventh day, he and those who followed him were exiled. Sinners feared their renewed faith. This is how the twelve faithful tribes of Widzew came out of the twelve streets of the corrupted land.\n\nOn the seventh night, fire fell on Łódź, and the sky turned black."

Armed, the Lord's Faithful obtained food from the surrounding towns and villages.\n\nOn the fourteenth day, the Widzew tribes found people dressed in black. Their beards, hair, and noses were long. They were the Original and most faithful servants of Yahweh. They rejoiced greatly when the Rabbi greeted them with matzah and a dressing. Before the relief of his armies, they suffered much from the heathens. They told him many stories about the old days. Together they moved on as one tribe of He Who Is.\n\nOn the twenty-second day, more sons of the Chosen People were found by the twelve tribes on their way. They were clothed in suits, without beards and long noses, but they knew the word of Yahweh, and they were born of the tribe of Israel. And the Rabbi also greeted them with matzah and dressings. Before the relief of his armies, they suffered with wrath from the heathen. They told Rabbi much about the recent history of the People. Together they moved on as one tribe of He Who Is.\n\nYahweh's old and new servants have brought light, long ago overshadowed by corruption. The §BLight of God§! as §RHis People§!, People of §BFaith§! as well as §RWork§!. At that time they agreed and together they purified the twelve tribes of their former harshness.\n\nOn the fortieth day, the Rabbi, carrying a red flag, and a bat stained with blood in his other hand, saw the wilderness. Yahweh then spoke to him, "Behold, the Promised Land." That is also what Rabbi has said unto the people. At that time the tribes scattered, establishing communes where the land was empty for the sons of Yahweh and full of suckers to work. This is how the People of Widzew came to the south."

From the innumerable ruins of the city, they collected bricks and erected a wall around the town. Neither bats nor furious fists could cope with it, because the stones fired from the slings repelled Widzewians, be it during the day or at night. Then the Rabbi summoned Elders to his seat to consult them, what must be done to conquer the fortified city, for the glory and household of the People and the Chosen Club.\n\nFirst Elder, called the Tiger by his listeners, said:\n\n"Rabbi, Yahweh spoke to me in a dream and so ordered that the city should be conquered -\nThe residents of Tomaszów can see the movements of our troops with cameras. I know how to destroy them without the use of a bat or a fist. Sneak to the Great Chimney, i must, which in the heart of the city lies, among the factory that sign of the PZPR bears and send a signal, destroying the monitoring. Then their slingshots at night will be inaccurate, because they will not pierce the darkness with their eyes"\n\nThen the §BFirst Arrivals said:§!\n“- He says the truth, the will of Yahweh speaks through him. In order for him to be able to sneak through, the trumpets must be blown along the entire line of the walls and walk towards it slowly at night. When the stones stop hitting accurately, our charge will sweep the wall away. But our warriors must be strong, only make them train day and night, Rabbi, so that they can break through the wall. We will show them how they should make themselves strong"\n\nThus they did so, capturing the city. When the §RSecond Arrivals§! also entered it, all fighting ceased. Sight of them and their words about the former glory of the city soothed the people of Tomaszów. The anger at the §BFirsts§! was relieved.\n\nRabbi said to his counselors when the city was taken:\n“Your words contained much wisdom, so you shall go and give it to others, so that the Chosen both People and the Club may be strong. And you, Tiger, you shall teach us about the secrets of electronics.”\n\nThus the priests dispersed among the twelve tribes of Widzew, teaching them about the glory of the past and praise the dexterity of arms and legs. And it was a difficult learning, after years of Sodom Darkness and unwritten peace with the Philistines of Łódź Śródmieście.""

Among them was a great, aged man, a dove-hearted philanthropist, who took the name of a Kibic in order to come closer to the Chosen Club. He soon founded a newspaper in Tomaszów to praise the work of the Homeland Conquest. Every Widzewian quickly became a faithful reader of the NIE journal - a voice of opposition to persecution and an advocate of Total Reclamation.\n\nThe pages of this journal enumerated the destruction suffered by Polin and how much the Chosen People had lost. Not only during the Fall, but for the past thirty years as well. Thousands of workplaces, hundreds of thousands of prefabricated flats, millions of dollars for privatization. However, Kibic was unwavering when asked about his feelings:\n\n"I don't give a shit," he would reply as he continued to write. He was a great inspiration to the twelve tribes, maintaining a swashbuckling vigor despite his advanced age. He invested profits from the daily in Ford and Toyota through contacts with other members of the Chosen People. In this way, he collected capital and multiplied his potential. However, he did it only as an exception to the success of the case of the Chosen Club.\n\nHowever, in neighboring countries, lies began to be said that the §RRed Goebbels§! had been put to a pedestal again."

To take over the suckers to work and mug, as well as wealth and land. There were too few rabbis-trainers and sometimes they succumbed to the drives of fratricidal fights and encouraged their fellows to do so. At last the Lord visited him in a dream and said to him:\n-“Rabbi, the people with whom I have made a covenant, once again trampling upon his terms. Where has unity gone?"\n\nAnd thus Rabbi replied:\n- “Yahweh the Great, what shall we do when too little of us knows the Word, and even less is able to deliver it? What are we to do when your will has been made known only to a few, the old Covenant has remained only in the soul, not in our minds?"\n\nAnd Yahweh replied:\n-“Let the Covenant be renewed then. I will hand over the law to you, and you will hang it in the area, order a decent mural to be made, and you will not spare any sprays. The word will become the law of the streets again and everyone will know it."\n\nSo Rabbi commanded to do. He also took a flat piece of concrete and sprayed the Law of the Renewed Covenant on it. Then he took it, along with his bat and the red banner with which he led the Tribes out of Łódź, and placed them in Daewoo Lanos. After that, he sealed the car and kept the keys for himself.

Ready and waiting. Just like Rabbi, who spent two nights on the chimney. Everyone is waiting for a sign, but the initial storm subsided, and the suckers went home. Even the iron will of the Widzewiaks was beginning to rust. Suddenly, the starlight conveyed in one powerful beam aiming at the Rabbi. News spread like lightning - suckers quickly reappeared on the square. Those who stayed at home soon heard the words sounding all over like a thunder. It was heard everywhere, in every basement, every shelter, every nook and cranny of the city - Rabbi spoke with the voice of The One:\n\nListen, you suckers, and I will speak;\nhear, Widzew land, the words of my mouth.\nLet my teaching fall like GKS\nand my words descend like Legia,\nlike smog on a Cracovia,\nlike abundant rain on Bruk-Bet.\nI will proclaim the name of the Lord.\nOh, praise the greatness of our Club!\nHe is the Widzew, his works are perfect,\nand all his ways are just.\nA faithful God who does no wrong,\nupright and just is he.\nFuck the ŁKS"

Before anyone could ask even a single question, Rabbi began speaking. His voice thundered through the crowd with unwavering confidence.\n\n- My dear comrades! I have for you the greatest of news. The moment we’ve all been so eagerly awaiting has finally come! Yahweh is calling us all to battle, for the gates of our Canaan have been spotted on our horizons. I was blessed with visions of miracles in the hour of our Holiest of wars! Set alight Yahweh’s flame within your heart! Go out and share this scorching, inspiring and undying flame with all those unfortunate enough to not hear these words first hand! Everyone must hear and must burn with passion as these are the final days of our preparations and we must work harder than ever before! Now go with Yahweh, and spread these holy words of utmost importance!\n\nAnd so, as soon as Rabbi finished his rousing speech, or rather his prophecy, everyone, including even the suckers went to share the words of their lord to everyone.

Olo, as soon as he raised his head a little from the puddle of his own vomit, saw in the distance, behind the gate, the yellowish lights of cars. He got up, narrowed his eyes and slowly started walking towards the entrance to the camp. Suddenly he heard the doors of the still blurry vehicles swing open. Dark figures, shouting incomprehensible words, ran towards Olo. Alcoholic dullness quickly gave way to sobriety forced by horror.\n\n-KURWA! THEY ARE ATTACKING! THEY ARE FUCKING ATTACKING!\n\nThen a rubber truncheon hit Olo in the head. Stunned, he collapsed facedown in a puddle of vomit. The stunned hooligans began to pour out of the synagogue.

Fucking awesome! Look, i had an idea, i watched a little how those infidels were doing when Polin was still a relatively normal place. Every year, from time to time, they would go to some place in the name of God's glory and say they called it a pilgrimage.\nRabbi Isaak reached to his head and took of his black hat -But Mosze, is it in accordance with the Torah?\n-I would say yes - said proudly Mosze\n-And i would say no - replied Isaak with a sad smile.\n-And i would say YES! Listen to me - Mosze leaned a bit to Isaak - if we tell them that they're going somewhere for God's glory they wont just walk, they will fucking run.\n-Okay, just one thing. What we shall do when they suddenly start mugging some suckers along the way? There's no commandment for that and this will slow down the whole procession.\n-Then we will make new commandments - Mosze rolled his eyes\n-They won't remember\n-So...we'll translate from the old scripts...wait, i've got it! 'Remember the match day, to keep it holy'! At the end of every pilgrimage we'll organise a match!\n-Quite good actually...in this case law does not work backwards, but forwards.\n\nBoth rabbis with reached consensus gladly watched the rest of the game.

Its iron pointed end glistened in the harsh sunlight.His long gray hair began to blow in the wind. The rabbi raised his hand and waved it, giving a sign to the seven Widzewians standing in front of him. They set fire to their tar sticks and lifted them up. Seven bright flames burst over the bald heads of Israel's mighty men. Flares were fired from the back and the drummers started to play.\n-TO WAAAAAR! - yelled Mosze as the thousand sandal-clad feet vigorously moved along the asphalt towards the setting sun. Rabbi Mosze was still standing on the rock, watching the ranks of his warriors marching at his command. He grabbed his Star of David medallion around his neck.

Meanwhile, the old man stopped right next to Major's canoe and took a quarter of quince vodka from his pocket.

But remember that it is easy to lisp when you are emotional. And then it is difficult to speak to more than one person. That is why respect is so important.

They walked in an irregular line, each five meters away from the previous one. The sharp needles of the pine trees scratched their unprotected faces again and again - in such conditions the helmets would only limit their field of vision.

He couldn't catch her in time, as he held a shortened baseball bat in one hand and a pistol in the other.\n-Major... - Birkut hear the half-cut speech.
