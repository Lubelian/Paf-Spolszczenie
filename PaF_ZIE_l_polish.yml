unification.118.desc:0 "While most within Poland are blinded by their lust for power, fighting merely to impose their will over the nation, there still remain those who strive for something greater. As petty warlords send thousands to die in vain, the very earth that welcomes their corpses is dying underneath their feet. Worse yet, some within the country strive to accelerate this decay, oblivious that they’re only bringing forth their own demise. Yet perhaps, nature might still be saved, as Poland’s heart – the Capital District, has been overtaken by environmentalist forces of the enigmatic Wawer Commune. Ever since its capture, Warsaw has been rapidly transformed, with factories shut down, car traffic banned, and those found responsible for damaging the climate placed before sham trials. And though the greater goals of this state and even their leader’s true identity remain a mystery, one thing can be said for certain – the green militia will not rest until all polluters have been brought to justice."
