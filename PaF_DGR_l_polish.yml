 DGR_faction_desc: "Securing power in the city wasn't as easy as it was in General Secretary's mind. Dozens of minor factions were squabbling between themselves after the Fall, fighting for scraps of once prosperous city in the region. Most of them were simply gangs and raiders, but there are also some ideological groups of fanatics. Remnants of Dąbrowa Górnicza local parliament were disbanded and forced to flee before some bandits could hang them up on the nearest lantern. They've found a shelter in Katowice Steelworks, biggest complex of this kind in the whole Poland. But factory was already controlled by Communist Party of Poland, and so they unexpectedly have gained a leadership over Dąbrowa's legitimate government, and it was up to them to bring order in the city."

 ## Events ##
 
 unification.14.t: "[GetNewspaper]Dąbrowa Górnicza unifies Zagłębie and Jura!"
 unification.14.desc: "In an unexpected turn of events, a little dictatorship from Dąbrowa Górnicza managed to conquer their surrounding territories. Surrounded by more powerful enemies, it held on, and thanks to the Katowice Steelworks and the power of industry it prevailed against the early onslaught, conquering Jura.\nThe strange combination of communism and nationalism has proved to be stable and effective so far. It is not entirely clear what the relations between individual factions are, but taking into account their morale - we cannot count on an imminent end to this pact of two devils.\nThe People's Front of Zagłębie (as was their official name) now has at its disposal the untamed industrial power of the Dąbrowa Basin. It would seem that they will hit Silesia next, but unofficial sources seem to report that their eyes are focused on Lesser Poland."
 unification.14.a: "Lightning is Red!"

 unificationreg.14.t: "[GetNewspaper]National People's Army unifies Lesser Poland"
 unificationreg.14.desc: "Lesser Poland chose socialism over death. It was not entirely a free and conscious choice, because in such places as Wawel Castle or the wild spaces of the Tatra Mountains, shots can still be heard. National Bolshevik troops with resolute determination to liberate every workplace (especially heavy industry such as steelworks) triumphed everywhere from Przemsza to Dunajec. The fire from industrial furnaces is blazing again, along with the spirit of communism aided by nationalist rhetoric.\n\nHowever, there are more and more frequent reports of internal disputes, not all communists want to refer to the ideological bloody legacy of Mieczysław Moczar, and fewer and fewer nationalists want to continue to cooperate with the advocates of communism that enslaved this country for 50 years. Heavily funded propaganda reassures citizens for now, but the first cracks are beginning to appear on this grand hybrid project."
 unificationreg.14.a: "Hammer will forge an iron sword!"

 unificationsupreg.14.t: "[GetNewspaper]National People's Army unifies Galicia"
 unificationsupreg.14.desc: "During crises, makeshift states often collapse. The National People's Army overcame all the internal problems faced by this unusual ideological mix. What the party proclaimed as a refreshing of intra-party quality was in fact a massive purge of political opponents and internal factions that began to form in this burgeoning political project.\n\nFor a quite some time already, NPA ceased to be only a paramilitary group, as the growing tissue of the party apparatus took over many civilian functions. For this reason, Krzysztof Szwej, after the military parade in Lublin, announced the creation of the National People's Republic of Poland, releasing at the same time a national liberation manifesto addressed to all citizens in Poland - The victorious working class of the Polish nation is coming, and the only true government of this country started here, in Lublin. Just like hundred years before."
 unificationsupreg.14.a: "National People's Army must win!"

 super.14.t: "[GetNewspaper]National People's Army unifies Poland!"
 super.14.desc: "Great struggle of the national working class is over. A militaristic country whose two main guiding pillars are fanatical nationalism and hard-line communism is entering the international arena causing panic among neighboring countries. Separately, these two ideologies are the enemies of the free world, together they are the axis of evil in the eyes of Western observers.\nInside the country, it is also not entirely clear what is really going on and what is propaganda. After a bloody civil war, it is impossible to tell who died as a result of the war and who was "redistributed". Internment camps also remain in areas where not a single shot has been fired for several years, and all political organizations are disbanded and replaced by replacements under the control of the main party.\nNational People's Republic of Poland is moving with certain steps towards another world revolution, and Europe is so weak and divided that the second half of the 21st century may still belong to National Bolshevism."
 super.14.a: "SOCIALISM OR DEATH!"
