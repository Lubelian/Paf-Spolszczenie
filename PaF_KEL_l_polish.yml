unification.121.desc:0 "Few expected a collapse of Ziobro regime. Even fewer expected that after said collapse, Kelthuz would emerge victorious over other competitors. 'Most hated libertarian bard of Poland' has successfully led an alliance of anarcho-capitalists, pagan fanatics and nihilist against all forms of leftism, christianity and altruism.\n One of his first actions after seizing the control of voivodeship was plundering the Holy Trinity Abbey and selling the Holy Cross relic to raise funds for his army.\n The whole Poland frowns their faces with disgust for this blasphemous action and also because the Steel Commander broadcasted a promise to fornicate with other warlords' mothers after he defeats them."
