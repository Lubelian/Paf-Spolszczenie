unification.144.desc:0 "No one expected to see Berkowicz rise to prominance after the series of the humiliations that was his political career. Before the Fall his go-to strategy was to mimic the seemingly succesful tactic of Janusz Korwin-Mikke by raising as much controversies as possible with identical talking points. His strategy didin't succeed back then. Apparently, one Korwin was enough. But after Korwin's death there was a raising demand for this kind of agressive laissez-faire rethoric. And Berkowicz delivered unifying his voivodeship when the Cracow government collapsed. Who knows, maybe after decades of being ignored he will finally rise to prominance."
