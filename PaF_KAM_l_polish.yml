unification.71.t:0 "[GetNewspaper]Kampfgruppe Westpolen unifies Lubuskie!"
unification.71.desc:0 "Tanks roll across western Poland as dreams of freedom slowly turn to ash. Such is the new reality in Lubuskie as the region has found itself under even more direct German control than before. No longer ruled, even nominally, by a Pole, as white-and-red flags are being lowered and replaced by banners featuring black, red, and gold. The true muscle of the fallen Eurokommisariats, the army of the Kampfgruppe Westpolen under general Markus Laubenthal now sits in control of the voivodeship as preparations for the next stage of operations begin. No longer shackled by the ineptitude of his former Polish comrades and at last able to dispel all pretenses of fighting for the liberation of the struggling nation, the Kampfgruppe aims to finally achieve their true goal. Deliver Poland into the arms of Germany."
