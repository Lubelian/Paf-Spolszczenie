unification.71.desc:0 "Tanks roll across western Poland as dreams of freedom slowly turn to ash. Such is the new reality in Lubuskie as the region has found itself under even more direct German control than before. No longer ruled, even nominally, by a Pole, as white-and-red flags are being lowered and replaced by banners featuring black, red, and gold. The true muscle of the fallen Eurokommisariats, the army of Kampfgruppe Westpolen under General Markus Laubenthal now sits in control of the voivodeship as preparations for the next stage of operations begin. No longer shackled by the ineptitude of his former Polish comrades and at last able to dispel all pretenses of fighting for the liberation of the struggling nation, the Kampfgruppe aims to finally achieve their true goal. Deliver Poland into the arms of Germany."

unificationreg.71.desc:0 "The German eagle spreads its wings over Poland once more, as the incessant march of the Bundeswehr has led to the restoration of the majority of Eurokommissariat Schlesien’s former territory under the Kampfgruppe’s control. The shackles of occupation, only so recently broken, rest heavy on the hands of Breslau’s residents once more, only this time the conqueror’s grip is even tighter. Hardened by experiences of Schetyna’s failures at maintaining stability, Laubenthal has imposed a strict military rule over the region, with any sign of anti-EU activity and rhetoric quashed and heavily punished. Aiming to deter the Poles from daring to rise up yet again, whether this effort will succeed in finally pacifying the local population or merely further enrage them remains to be seen."

unificationsupreg.71.desc:0 "After a hundred years of separation, Silesia finds itself in the Fatherland’s grip once more. The sight of Panzers storming into the Silesian Metropolis, surpassing even the furthest extent of the original invasion force’s advance, has sent shockwaves around the nation as it is quickly becoming apparent that the Kampfgruppe and their masters in Berlin will stop at nothing except Poland’s complete subjugation. Ever since the conclusion of their latest campaign, unprecedented amounts of military equipment and personnel can be seen crossing the heavily guarded border nearly every day in a move signaling the beginning of preparations for a final assault, meant to eradicate all remaining traces of the nation’s sovereignty. The fate of Poland hangs in the balance, as over a thousand years of history may soon be coming to an end."
