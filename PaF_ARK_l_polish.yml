arka_exodus.1.desc:0 "In the past couple of days European social media has been taken by storm by pictures of... a gigantic wooden ark traversing up north across the Baltic Sea. \nThe first sighting of the ship dates back to last week, when a fisherman illegally operating near the Polish coast published a tweet containing a photo of an enormous wooden vessel the likes of Noah's Ark, bearing the logo of Arka Gdynia - a Polish football club. Soon after, more vessels from Visby reported seeing the very same ship heading vaguely towards the Swedish mainland. Various Swedish media outlets managed to conduct interviews with members of the Ark, chief amongst them Zbigniew Rybak - headsman of the Ark's constructors. Apparently, the club has conducted a mass exodus to Sweden with the goal of returning to their country to rebuild it from the beginning once it finally stops disintegrating itself into the Dark Ages."
