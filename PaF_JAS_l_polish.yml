unification.73.t:0 "[GetNewspaper]Lizard Union unites West Pomerania!"
unification.73.desc:0 "West Pomerania, or Hinterpommern as it was frequently called until now, one of the regions of Poland which came under control of the EU interventionist forces, has finally been liberated, and the government responsible for this liberation is, lightly speaking, very unorthodox in its ideology and policies. Staunch Polish “neonationalists” of the recently proclaimed West Pomeranian Lizard Union led by actor Wojciech Olszański, who currently goes by the name “Aleksander Jabłonowski” seek above all to eliminate all enemies of Poland, especially the remaining  German elements. Given Jabłonowski’s explosive temperament and pro-Russian sentiment, the results of this new Polish rejuvenation are hard to predict, but should the Lizard Union achieve its’ goal, it will, without a doubt, bring some big changes to the Poland we know."
