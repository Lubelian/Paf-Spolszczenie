unification.73.t:0 "[GetNewspaper]Lizard Union unites West Pomerania!"
unification.73.desc:0 "West Pomerania, or Hinterpommern as it was frequently called until now, one of the regions of Poland which came under control of the EU interventionist forces, has finally been liberated, and the government responsible for this liberation is, lightly speaking, very unorthodox in its ideology and policies. Staunch Polish “neonationalists” of the recently proclaimed West Pomeranian Lizard Union led by actor Wojciech Olszański, who currently goes by the name “Aleksander Jabłonowski” seek above all to eliminate all enemies of Poland, especially the remaining  German elements. Given Jabłonowski’s explosive temperament and pro-Russian sentiment, the results of this new Polish rejuvenation are hard to predict, but should the Lizard Union achieve its’ goal, it will, without a doubt, bring some big changes to the Poland we know."
unification.73.a:0 "Long live the kamrats!"

unificationreg.73.t:0 "[GetNewspaper]The Lizards rule Pomerania"
unificationreg.73.desc:0 "Unexpected news has broken, as the 2 Pomeranian voivodeships of Poland have been united under the bloodstained banner of the New Lizard Union. The Union’s leader, Aleksander Jabłonowski, formerly known as Wojciech Olszański, has seemingly gone insane and cut himself off from all former advisors. He now rules the state by himself with an iron hand. The system he has implemented is a horrifying form of social Darwinism, where all of the supreme leader’s enemies are hunted down, attacked, and often challenged to a fight to the death by the leader himself, leading to bloody duels where only one man can remain standing. This is no longer about Poland, but rather about the spill of blood, and the next people whose blood will be spilled are sure to be the rivalling governments’ soldiers, and civilians…"
unificationreg.73.a:0 "The Lizard has finally fulfilled his threats."

unificationreg.731.t:0 "[GetNewspaper]Rise of the Greater Slavic State of Vistula"
unificationreg.731.desc:0 "A new order seems to have emerged in the north of Poland, as the young Polish(?) government has surfaced because internal issues forced the West Pomeranian “Lizard Union” to reform into a completely different entity. After unifying their home voivodeship, Jabłonowski ended up working closely with one Maciej Poręba, a notorious supporter of Russia and the pan-slavic ideology. This bizarre new state managed to crush their eastern neighbour - a united Pomeranian voivodeship, and have decided to head south instead of conquering Masuria, possibly due to its proximity to the Kaliningrad oblast. Poręba’s exact intentions are unknown, but it is certain that he aims to change the identity of Poland’s citizens forever, for better or for worse. His fanaticism combined with Jabłonowski’s seemingly unending fury make for a dangerous combination, and the so-called “slavic wolves” are adamant in their pursuit of a new nation built with fire and iron."
unificationreg.731.a:0 "Is this a new dawn for slavic unity?"

unificationreg.732.t:0 "[GetNewspaper]The “Lizards” become the Polish National Union"
unificationreg.732.desc:0 "It seems like all the traces of the EU intervention in Poland are getting closer to being completely removed, as soldiers of the Polish National Union have recently marched into Gdańsk and taken over the entire territory of the Pomeranian Voivodeship. All remnants of Germanic influence are being aggressively weeded out, with many ethnic Germans being forced into exile, with the campaign being compared to the USSR’s actions in Poland following World War 2. Jabłonowski seems to have committed to his alter ego/persona quite a bit more, with some people no longer associating the name of “Wojciech Olszański” with him. As Jabłonowski’s government, the “Polish National Council of Comrades”, becomes increasingly belligerent, the future of Western Poland seems to be one decided by strength and dedication, and it would without a doubt take significant military effort to stop the Lizards’ momentum now."
unificationreg.732.a:0 "We will rip out our enemies’ hearts!"

unificationsupreg.73.t:0 "[GetNewspaper]Western Poland conquered and butchered by lizard army"
unificationsupreg.73.desc:0 "The fighting force considered to be more brutal in all of Poland has yet again swept through new territory as the Great Slavic Wolves Army extends its reach to the Greater Poland and Kuyavia regions, as well as the former Łódzkie voivodeship. So far, the policies of the Great Army can be simply described as killing anyone who opposes them or simply wrongs them in any way. It’s hard to say if they have a higher purpose in their actions, or if this is simply going to become an endless self-fueling cycle of violence. One thing that is certain is that these people are no longer Polish nationalists – they are a wild, enraged horde of soldiers ready to tear all who stand in their path to shreds."
unificationsupreg.73.a:0 "Storm clouds gather"

unificationsupreg.731.t:0 "[GetNewspaper]“Privislinsky Krai” returns"
unificationsupreg.731.desc:0 "The Greater Slavic State of Vistula, possibly the most pro-Russian contender in the Polish civil war ever since Jabłonowski’s ideas were rejected, has now gone beyond their home region of Pomerania and conquered a substantial amount of territory in central and western Poland, and adopted the old tsarist name of “Privislanskiy Krai'” which translates to Vistula Krai/Land. According to the government’s agenda, the citizens of what the world knows as Poland are not Poles, and that was never their true identity, but rather a façade, and the inhabitants of that territory are “Lechites” AKA “Slavic Wolves”, descendants of a supposed ancient civilisation called Lechina. Poręba is not the only proponent of the Lechina theory, but he is different from the others because he firmly believes the only way to restore and preserve Lechina is by cooperating with Russia and fulfilling their pan-Slavic vison. This is obviously a very controversial policy, and many in Poland are shocked by Poręba’s ideals. But this will not stop him – only war can."

unificationsupreg.732.t:0 "[GetNewspaper]The Polish National Union tightens their grip over western Poland"
unificationsupreg.732.desc:0 "Aleksander Jabłonowski’s “Lizards” have expanded beyond Pomerania, successfully conquering Greater Poland and the Łódzkie Voivodeship, and consolidating power as the Polish National Union. Their mission to “rebuild” Poland is nearing completion, but they still need to beat a powerful contender, the current Silesian government which also controls Polish Lusatia. Their enemies’ industrial might is now the only thing which stands in their way before they can attack the eastern bank of the Vistula river. As the Polish National Council of Comrades continues ruling with an iron hand, people all across the 4 voivodeships under Jabłonowski’s control prepare for the next battle, and under Jabłonowski and Sendecki’s ever-ruthless leadership, that battle is sure to be a bloody one"
unificationsupreg.732.a:0 "We’re gonna fucking fight! You human louse, you motherfucker!"

super.73.t:0 "[GetNewspaper]Heart of Poland torn out"
super.73.desc:0 "It seems as though Poland is once again lost, and this time for sure. This time is different than the previous trials and tribulations the nation has been through in that this time the threat comes not from foreign incursions, but from the inside, better yet, from the most internal institution possible – the Polish government. Although to be fair, calling it Polish is not very accurate at this point. Aleksander Jabłonowski’s government, originally known as the New Lizard Union, has devolved into a chaotic highly militarised state known officially as the Slavic Wolf Territory. The “wolves” in question are Jabłonowski’s bloodthirsty soldiers, and they only adhere to the values that Jabłonowski himself taught them – the values of blood, battle, and vengeance. Anyone who opposes this psychotic order will be hunted down and killed without mercy, their heart being ripped out of their chest. Poland is up in flames, and if the crazed wolf’s rampage continues, it will burn to ashes, leaving nothing behind."
super.73.a:0 "God, you who has shielded Poland…"

super.731.t:0 "[GetNewspaper]The Wolfpack reigns supreme in a pro-Russian Poland"
super.731.desc:0 "A national rejuvenation is afoot in the nation formerly known as Poland, as Marcin Poręba’s “Privislanskiy Krai” shifts the politics of the country in a way never seen before in Polish history. It would be wrong to even call this state “Poland”, as Poręba has curbed both Jabłonowski’s influence, and virulent nationalism, as well as rooted out the Polish national identity. He has dubbed his citizens “Lechites” and considers them merely one of many cogs in the great Pan-Slavic machine which is powered by Russia. His vendetta against what he calls “the greatest lie in Lechite history” is yielding results, as there are already people in the Vistula Land who do not feel themselves to be Polish and believe in Poręba’s bizarre form of Pan-Slavism. But not everyone is so eager to follow their leader. As long as Jabłonowski and Poręba’s “wolfpack” of “slavic wolves” remains in power, they will need to face many challenges from their opposition. And they no doubt intend to conquer these challenges in the same way as they always have – with violence and terror."
super.731.a:0 "…Lord, preserve our wołodia!"

super.732.t:0 "[GetNewspaper]Polish People’s National Republic takes control"
super.732.desc:0 "Today, Poland has officially been unified and changed in an unexpected fashion. The Polish National Council of Comrades led by Wojciech Olszański AKA Aleksander Jabłonowski and his right-hand man Eugeniusz Sendecki. The ideology of this ruling institution has been described by foreign observers as a form of “National Bolshevism” combining communist collectivism with violent ethno-nationalism. What this means in practice is a burning hatred for anything western, the desire to preserve the Polish catholic identity at all costs, and a policy of putting the Polish people first… As long as the government considers them upstanding citizens, of course. This naturally comes at the expense of minorities’ rights and Poland’s integration with the west. Most western European countries are shocked by this turn of events, and human rights activists have already accused the Republic’s government of committing ethnic cleansing. It is unknown how the situation will evolve, but Poland will surely never be the same again."
