unification.114.desc:0 "As the People's Militia continues to persecute the inhabitants of Warsaw, Monika Jaruzelska declares herself to be a triumphant in the struggle for the Capital Region. A daughter of controversial communist leader Wojciech Jaruzelski, she tries to recreate his harsh policy by implementing a martial law until Poland is united. Although she stylises herself as a sincere communist dictator, some left-wing critics claim it's just a way of invoking nostalgia in older generation and in truth 'Lady Comrade's' policies will appease the neoliberals and the far-right."
