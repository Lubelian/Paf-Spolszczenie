unification.97.desc:0 "When the Kaliningrad leftovers of Putin's regime crossed the border to invade Warmia-Masuria it was predicted by most that they would have been eventually pushed back as soon as any Polish government managed to reorganize itself, after all, their military "might" was put on full display in the 2022 invasion of Ukraine.\nWhat wasn't predicted by most though, was that Warmia's eventual liberators would be Taliban veterans and middle eastern migrants under the command of a former member of the EU parliament.\n\nSikorski's Republic of Warmia has as of today proclaimed their overlordship over former Warmia-Masuria after a string of victories against their (presumably just as insane) rivals and Russian invaders. \n \n Many still wonder how a warband of Muslims led by a Muslim convert managed to establish itself in one of the most Catholic societies in Europe, these questions have so far been answered with "The will of Allah" by the more theologically involved of the Republic."
