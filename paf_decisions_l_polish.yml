His words are to live by for all governments and *especially* for corporate entities like ourselves - numbing down the populace's voice is what we are built upon in the first place.

corp_expand_security_forces:0 "Offer Contracts for Temporary Army Duty"
corp_expand_security_forces_desc:0 "Food security is very low in post-Fall Poland, and there's lots of struggling people who'd be willing to serve in the army in exchange for food and money, but cannot leave their families alone, as then they'd be left without a breadwinner. Therefore - how about we offer these people contracts for *temporary* army duty? The Russian government used a similar method of hiring new people for the army during their invasion of Ukraine, where anyone of working age could simply hit up their local wojenkomat (army drafting commitee, or WKU in Polish) and sign up for service on the front for a limited time. These contract troops would receive their salary only after some time spent on the front, meaning that many of them died without even getting paid, meaning that we can use this conscription method to gain new recruits while simultaneously keeping our money."

This system ensures that we've always got access to a large manpower pool, but it also creates the need to balance the ratio between the levy and our own men as to not let them outnumber us too much, as that would let 'em easily overwhelm us in a potential rebelion.

However, as their conditions worsen, strikes, organized movements and even open violence become much more alluring to them. Therefore, we should take up preventive measures to dissolve any worker movements before their proportions grow too large for us to handle."

Therefore, we should buy them out and incorporate them into our corporate web, forever trapping them inside ourselves."
corpo_monopoles_tt:0 "By integrating these various enterprises into our corporate structure, we also branch out our field of operations on the market, potentially resulting in §Glarge-scale benefits§!.

Well... shit, i-it's not important, people know that we don't really care about them anyway. However, they cannot feel completely abandoned by everyone, as that would extinguish their willingness to fight, for they need *a cause* or *someone* to fight for - even slimy fucks such as ourselves have a cause to fight for, such as upholding religious values. Yes.. we need to entrench religion in our people's hearts - not only for our gain, but also for moral reasons, and for *our survival*, for God is with His humble flock, but those who reject His word end up rotting in Hell."

Now we capitalize on those very people, trying to suck up to them in exchange for their loyalty, and OH BOY is their loyalty profitable for us - if we asked them nicely, they'd give us all their lifesavings and possessions. In fact, using the clergy as henchmen for gathering additional taxes from our loyalists is already common in the our administration, so it's completely fine if we ask them for a handout to cover our army's upkeep - after all, every grosz not spent on our forces is a grosz earned by Germans, Russians and lefties!"

In fact, it's only natural that we have our own force serving our interests and defending our turf - after all, we believe that one should defend their possessions themselves, instead of having to rely on others. Our armed forces are meant to be but a security force that is organized by ourselves and is guarding our lands and interests from enemies. And we treat them as such, upkeeping and arming them ourselves. Because of that we also don't need to follow any set norms or standards when handling their equipment - they're OUR OWN business, so we are allowed to provide them with equipment in any way we could possibly like to, e.g. with cheaply produced 3D printed guns, instead of expensive, real ones."
