unification.148.desc:0 "When the Free City of Kraków collapsed under the growing influence and squabbling of its academic institutions, few expected a meaningful force to emerge from the rubble. And yet, having not only reclaimed the rebellious northern districts but also repulsed all the regional warlords who laid claim to the metropolis, the militia of the Jagiellonian University has established control over the entirety of Lesser Poland. The aims of the Rector so far remain largely enigmatic, except for the already greatly increased funding of the sciences. Through various programs and educational campaigns, the historical institution strives to combat the growing ignorance and illiteracy of the Polish anarchy, yet despite their noble intentions, it remains highly questionable whether this academic state will manage to hold its own against more established regional opposition eyeing the weakened city as a target for their next conquest."

unificationreg.148.desc:0 "Against all odds, rather than crumble under the onslaught of neighboring warlords, the forces of the Jagiellonian State managed to successfully expand their domain to encompass all of Small Galicia. Though a two-front conflict threatened the city, in the end, it was not the established military might of their competitors, but instead the people’s trust and dedication towards the Rector and his protective regime that ensured the eventual victory. After all, thanks to their efforts, while the rest of the country seems stuck in the renewed Dark Ages, Kraków enjoys a true Renaissance of culture and science. Indeed, intellectualism has overtaken the region in earnest, with the enlightened masses expected to dedicate themselves to the unending pursuit of knowledge. Soon, however, their internal focus may be disrupted yet again, as dark clouds gather over Poland, signaling the next wave of hostilities."

unificationsupreg.148.desc:0 "Galicia, oft regarded as Poland’s backwater, has now become the center of its academic golden age. Despite fierce local resistance, it appears no borders can stop the spread of this newfound educational fervor, as the steadily growing Jagiellonian forces handily subdued all regional opposition. Though much effort remains to integrate the hesitant eastern regions, the voivodeships’ respective elites overwhelmingly cheer this development on, heralding it as a chance to culturally restore the devastated territory. In the exalted halls of learning, however, rumors of increased fanaticism brew, with the ruling cadre’s passion for knowledge spiraling into an obsession with achieving intellectual perfection. As the Rector and his peers seclude themselves further in ancient, dusty tomes, the increasingly scarce communication with the outside world suggests a worrying turn towards the mystical, as through a growing disdain towards the modernity that threatened to crush their historical academic order, the Jagiellonians aim to bring back the glory days of humanist dominance."

super.148.t:0 "[GetNewspaper]The Eternal Academia victorious"
super.148.desc:0 "What once seemed impossible and in recent months nearly inevitable, has at last become reality. A shock to outside observers, the shattered nation of Poland has been reunified by the Jagiellonian academics. Emergent from the Free City of Kraków’s collapse and originally centered around the established hierarchies of the nation’s most historical university, the state has since developed into a cult of knowledge in all but name, with the intellectual elite entranced by a pursuit of spiritual immortality through the perpetual study of arcane, long-forgotten texts. Though the restored country seemingly stands ready to rejoin the world stage, so far, no such efforts have been made, as the nation seems preoccupied with its Faustian bargain. Gripped by madness, Poland has seemingly reverted to the days of mystical academia, a state at odds with time where knowledge intersects with the occult."
