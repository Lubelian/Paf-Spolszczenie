unification.12.desc:0 "New reports have come in from the Eastern reaches of Poland. After months of local conflicts, it appears that the entire Lublin Voivodeship is now under control of the Biłograj Breweries - a corporate state ruled by a wealthy, eccentric businessman Janusz Palikot.\n\nPalikot is mainly remembered as a controversial, socially progressive politician from the 2010s, before he left politics and decided to focus on his alcohol-related businesses. When the Polish state collapsed into anarchy, he used his wealth and influence to gain control of the region around his hometown, Biłgoraj. But even though many consider him to be mainly driven by expanding the company and his personal power, at the same time reports say that he does consistently introduce many socially progressive policies in his territory, like allowing gay marriage and seemingly encouraging atheism."
