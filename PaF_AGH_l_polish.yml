unification.147.t:0 "[GetNewspaper]The AGH University unifies Lesser Poland!"
unification.147.desc:0 "The Free City of Kraków - the sole unaltered vestige of pre-Fall Poland, has fallen. And though academics rose to fill the vacuum left behind by Majchrowski’s collapse, here too did a conservative force threaten to prolong the broken system. Yet, as per the words of the infallible adage, the modern ways of the AGH have inevitably triumphed over the Jagiellonians’ decrepit thought, creating a wave of enthusiasm and popular support sufficient to lead the institution to Lesser Poland’s full subjugation. Although he now formally stands as the region’s sole highest authority, Rector Lis has been forced to heavily rely upon local corporations to fill and finance his overstretched administration. Still, the locals cheer, as AGH’s victory and grandiose visions spark dreams of a future technological golden age for the backward country. For now, however, these hopes remain distant, as at any point a warlord’s might may render them all moot."
unification.147.a:0 "Can progress really emerge from Europe's backwater?"
