unification.106.desc:0 "Today, entire families are gathering in front of the few still functioning TVs in the country, attuned to the words of Zygmunt Solorz-Żak - the chairman of Cyfrowy Polsat S.A. and the de facto state the company controls. Grupa Polsat Plus' militias - initially serving as security forces guarding company assets - managed to carve out a statelet for themselves, later conquering all of southern Mazovian Voivodeship. Despite the ever so tightening corporate grip on independent entreprises, administration and law, the state's inhabitants seem to be kept content with bread and (digital) circuses and promises of security on corporate territory, accepting their quotas and contracts binding them to the Group. \nAs more and more Polsat Plus transmitters appear in neighbouring lands, Łódzkie's population - furious at Solorz-Żak for his involvement in the Polish SMR programme - starts intensifying its raids on company territory, and Polish and international observers begin making up predictions on how a Polsat-run Poland might look like."
