unification.106.desc:0 "Today, entire families are gathering in front of the few still functioning TVs in the country, attuned to the words of Zygmunt Solorz-Żak - the chairman of Cyfrowy Polsat S.A. and the de facto state the company controls. Grupa Polsat Plus' militias - initially serving as security forces guarding company assets - managed to carve out a statelet for themselves, later conquering all of southern Mazovian Voivodeship. Despite the ever so tightening corporate grip on independent entreprises, administration and law, the state's inhabitants seem to be kept content with bread and (digital) circuses and promises of security on corporate territory, accepting their quotas and contracts binding them to the Group. \nAs more and more Polsat Plus transmitters appear in neighbouring lands, Łódzkie's population - furious at Solorz-Żak for his involvement in the Polish SMR programme - starts intensifying its raids on company territory, and Polish and international observers begin making up predictions on how a Polsat-run Poland might look like."

unificationreg.106.desc:0 "Grupa Polsat Plus continues branching out into the fields of administration and military as the corporate state the company's been building on Poland's ruins cements its rule and expands further up the Vistula, having just reached the southernmost parts of the Holy Cross Voivodeship. \nThe Group has provided a steady flow of televised entertainment and internet access to the population living under its rule, making itself more presentable to the newly conquered population that now has to deal with corporate life most of their time, not only at work. \n\nAs neighbouring cliques start completely blocking access to Polsat Plus television and phone connections, international observers start predicting how a Polsat-owned Poland will look like, and how long can a company hold that many people under direct rule, before people finally get fed up with the everpresent yellow ball logo."

unificationsupreg.106.desc:0 "Despite it's military successes, Polsat's and Plus's restructurization from a media empire in a literal one becomes ever more difficult, as as the Group integrates more and more lands and businesses into its corporate web, its state must come up with new ways to legitimize its rule and to convince a population that once again becomes disused to living in chaotic anarchy that its money-driven, rather than ideological rule and promises of safety and rule of law (or rather ruleset) can satiate the Poles' thirst for ideological victory. todo"
