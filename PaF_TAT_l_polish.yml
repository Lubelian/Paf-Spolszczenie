unification.99.t:0 "[GetNewspaper]The Tatar Imamate unifies Podlasie!"
unification.99.desc:0 "An unfamiliar sound calls to the people of Podlasie. A song, unlike any other in Poland resonating from the newly constructed minarets. It speaks of the Creator’s glory, but what separates it from the countless religious chants popular in the country, is that this one is dedicated to Allah. In the greatest time of need, the Tatar community opened its arms and provided aid to the suffering Poles. Together, they built a state based on religious tolerance, where Christianity and Islam coexist. Under the guidance of Tomasz Miśkiewicz a new system of governance was established, combining the previously disparate moralities of the two faiths into one codex. This peaceful synthesis attracted many within the area as the ranks of the Tatars grew, allowing them to survive the following wars of unification. It’s clear, though that Poland will not accept Muslim rule peacefully, no matter how tolerant it may be."
unification.99.a:0 "Allahu Akbar. Ashhadu alla ilaha illallah. Hayya ‘alas-Salah."
