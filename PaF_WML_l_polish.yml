Given the right equipment and training, the scouts may become a major component of our armed forces, serving behind enemy lines as commandos skilled in diversionary tactics. But that’s not all. The scouts’ great concern for the preservation of the environment and development of rural areas will allow us to cultivate the parts of Poland usually left behind due to the inherent allure of industrial growth and at last strike a balance between nature and urbanization."

And even though their reactionary fanaticism is directly antithetical to our core ideas, their drive towards rebuilding the Polish industrial sector is an admirable, and most importantly highly effective one. Our more liberal-minded citizens might not appreciate this deal, but power doesn’t just come from thin air, and the sheer quantities of cheap energy that the Brotherhood offers make them indispensable to us."

Though this deal might not at first glance look as impressive and monumental as those with other potential allies, it does provide us with a resource desperately needed in these trying times – entertainment.

 ####5 PROBLEMÓW FOCUSY####

 WML_new_morning_in_old_lodz:0 "Nowy poranek w starej Łodzi"
 WML_new_morning_in_old_lodz_desc:0 "The sun rises again - and this time it's not artificial. Rubble has been cleared, most of the victims buried and the zone made off limits. Now Łódź looks as good as ever, although in this case the bar was set exceptionally low. With the most pressing matters dealt with, we can move on to solving further problems. This will be our first step on the road to regional reconstruction."

 WML_behind_the_curtains_of_denial:0 "Spojrzenie za kurtynę..."
 WML_behind_the_curtains_of_denial_desc:0 "Though some people in Łódź would still attribute the rising food prices to inflation caused by government's social programs and high cancer rates thanks to 5G transmitters, the ugly truth is we're in a much worse place than we would like to think we are. Nationwide collapse of society is a domino effect and sooner or later it will affect us. We should send out emissaries and conduct spying operations beyond our borders to find out what is happening in our region and check for every possibility to avert imminent shortages of resources. As long as we make the right decisions quickly, the social order hopefully won’t be turned upside down."

 WML_energy_issues:0 "Kwestie energetyczne"
 WML_energy_issues_desc:0 "Each day we're teetering on the brink of total blackout. Most of our power grid has always been old and decrepit, and it's serviced by those few power plants that are currently under our control. Łódź is the light shining in the darkness (not just because it's radioactive), and it can't go dark. We must discuss possibilities of supplying additional energy."

 WML_food_shortages:0 "Niedobór żywności"
 WML_food_shortages_desc:0 "Famine isn't a word said out loud in Łódź, although the situation is getting dire enough. Some people started to use toothpaste with vodka as an appetizer and that's a UN approved indicator of a humanitarian crisis. There is very little place to grow food in the city, so if we wish to avoid the shortage spiraling out of control, we might have to reach out to our neighbors for help."

 WML_lack_of_materials:0 "Brak materiałów"
 WML_lack_of_materials_desc:0 "The demand for raw materials exerted by every production center is, in our case, mostly unmet. Our factories and workshops are empty and our market’s supply mainly comprises scavenged or found second-hand products. This puts the health and safety of our populace at great risk, as well as threatens to pull off any semblance of a normal-functioning market out of our economy. Resuming trade is of utmost importance."

 WML_city_will_hold_on:0 "Miasto przetrwa"
 WML_city_will_hold_on_desc:0 "We have found a way to meet every basic need of our society. Although the balance is fragile, at the present there is nothing more we can do. Everything else will be fixed in time with further implementation of the power of the Dialogue."

 WML_striking_workers:0 "Strajkujący robotnicy"
 WML_striking_workers_desc:0 "Rising prices, decreasing quality of life, slacking social security and crippling lack of supplies all contribute to huge unrest among the working population of Łódź – and the tradition of lackluster workers’ rights enforcement in Pre-Fall Poland certainly did not help. We risk another 1905, but this time the revolution is quite likely to succeed. Dialogue is the way to solve this problem, but we must apply it with utmost care, lest we wish to spark the powder keg..."

 WML_minuscule_civil_guard:0 "Minimalna Ochrona Cywilów"
 WML_minuscule_civil_guard_desc:0 "With no delusions of making Łódź a safe city, we should nonetheless strive to make it as secure and stable as possible. With Polish Police practically disintegrated, the City Guard tried to stand up to this task – with predictable results. The formation is incompetent, yes, but first of all – understaffed and thinned out. As a result, crime is rampant, law goes unenforced, and our authority is a joke. For now, we need as many boots on the ground as we can get; quantity is a quality of its own."

 WML_and_a_look_onto_the_stage:0 "...i na scenę"
 WML_and_a_look_onto_the_stage_desc:0 "We may talk, we may assure, we may dance the same dance of Wyspiański’s Wedding, but we are not blind to our problems. Unlike our populace, that are our faithful dance partners, they are blissfully ignorant to just how bad things really are. This dance must go round and round until we manage to solve these issues.\n\nIf we break the tempo, well, let’s not dwell on that too much..."

 WML_hungry_and_lost:0 "Głodni i zagubieni"
 WML_hungry_and_lost_desc:0 "Our people may not realize it, but we are running almost exclusively on fumes, and even those are running out. Just about any basic resource a state would need, we do not have. Many of our shops and industrial facilities had to slow down work or completely go offline for the time being. We have to hurry up, the doomsday clock is ticking."

 WML_why_cant_we_just_agree:0 "Dlaczego nie możemy się zgodzić?"
 WML_why_cant_we_just_agree_desc:0 "Everyone in Łódź wants everything done their way. Those who see through the veil push for reform, those who don’t push through lines to get the last cup of coffee at their favorite coffee shop. Our job of keeping our citizen’s discontent to an absolute minimum is being stretched so thin, it is impossible to take our eyes off of it. We have to fix the issues with the social side of our affairs, to at the very least, prevent protests breaking out in the streets."

 WML_sow_the_seeds_of_dialogue:0 "Zasianie ziarna Dialogu"
 WML_sow_the_seeds_of_dialogue_desc:0 "Not everyone in our government is fully on board with Hołownia’s Dialogue. It’s hard to blame them really, so far Łódź has been in an everlasting downward spiral, and now it is just barely keeping itself afloat. But surely enough, if we simply talk to those who don’t agree with our peaceful rhetoric, they will come around. And if they don’t then they’ll wish they had when they’re looking for a new job."

 ####DIALOG FOCUSY####

 WML_the_beginning_of_the_dialogue:0 "Dialog się rozpoczyna"
 WML_the_beginning_of_the_dialogue_desc:0 "'No more blood spilled in Łódź' - that is the well known motto of Szymon Hołownia. Our president is determined to end the chaos in our voivodeship with the lowest number of casualties possible. To do so, he's ready to implement numerous concessions to various factions. Let the negotiations begin!"

 WML_election_of_vice_president: "Wybory wiceprezydenckie"
 WML_election_of_vice_president_desc:0 "Managing all those ridiculous warlords is a formidable task indeed. One that can't be accomplished alone. As much as he may not like it, Hołownia will have to share power with a vice-president. The warlords along with our own government have already put forward their “suggestions” for the position. We have the final say in the matter however, and whoever we pick will be eternally grateful to have such close ties with us."

 WML_send_out_delegations:0 "Wysłanie delegacji"
 WML_send_out_delegations_desc:0 "If we actually want the warlords around us to talk to us, then we’ll have to reach out to them first. We’ll assemble delegations including our best politicians and send them on their way deep into the heartlands of our soon to be partners. Getting them to talk about anything beyond purely material gain will be tough at first, but they’ll come to talk in no time."

 WML_insider_perspective:0 "Perspektywa insiderów"
 WML_insider_perspective_desc:0 "A team of delegates on it's own is not enough to see what makes the warlords tick, so we’ll send “economic advisors” over to their lands to poke around and gather valuable intel for us. A little bit of cloak-and-dagger never hurt anyone, and besides, who would ever suspect an advisor of spying on them?"

 WML_convene_general_assembly:0 "Zwołanie Walnego Zgromadzenia Łódzkiego"
 WML_convene_general_assembly_desc:0 "To expedite our negotiations with the warlords we have decided to push for the creation of a Council of delegates from each state. This group of five will reside in the capital district of Łódź to help speed up and simplify communication between our friends. A small drawback to this is that all the representatives will know about what we promise the others, possibly leading to some grievances."

 WML_industrial_lodz:0 "Łódź wśród fabryk"
 WML_industrial_lodz_desc: "The Brotherhood of Coal is one of the most reasonable candidates for an ally. With their military and industrial might, they guarantee a very powerful position in the Voivodeship, and maybe even in the other territories surrounding us. Something that prioritising the senile writer and some boys in shorts would not be able to accomplish in the short term."

 WML_forest_lodz:0 "Łódź wśród drzew"
 WML_forest_lodz_desc:0 "To put things bluntly: Łódź is the only REAL city in an area. Most of the terrain in the Voivodeships is one big forest with some rural areas sprinkled about. In that sort of environment the Scout’s rough and tumble lifestyle, and expertise in guerilla warfare will prove an invaluable asset in case of any possible conflicts and disasters that might strike us."

 WML_lodz_industry:0 "Łódź przemysłowa"
 WML_lodz_industry_desc:0 "The Brotherhood is an ever churning machine and if we wish to keep up with it we must rapidly expand our industrial potential. We’ll cut down parks and forests sick with the Bałutian plague and old rundown hovels to march onwards into the future. We’ll build great modern factories never before seen in Łódź, by pulling inspiration from the “Common Sense” preached by Ziemkiewicz."

 WML_renovation_of_lask_airport:0 "Renowacja lotniska w Łasku"
 WML_renovation_of_lask_airport_desc:0 "As a token of our appreciation we have decided to help out the Brotherhood by renovating the air force base in the city of Łask. Their workers are somewhat unsurprisingly very overstretched, with their ethos of breakneck industrialisation acting like a vacuum for skilled engineers, a void we can fill with some of our own. This would not only be seen as a great act of kindness on our part, but it would also supply our alliance with a fully operational airport ready for all of our military uses."

 WML_state_positions_for_the_power_plant_staff:0 "Zatrudnienie dla inżynierów"
 WML_state_positions_for_the_power_plant_staff_desc:0 "Industrial planners from the Brotherhood have reached out to us with a suggestion to a perceived problem they’ve noticed within our industrial sector. They claim we should employ even more engineers at our workplaces as we are apparently not operating at full capacity. While we’ve considered our production methods to be perfect as is, their helpful tip has really opened our eyes to how much potential we’re wasting by not putting more boots on the ground. This may however upset some of our current workers, as a more crowded workspace and new colleagues with less practice put into their work may not make the most pleasant work environment.\n\nThey’ll get used to it eventually."

 WML_mining_in_lodz:0 "Przyszłość wojewódzkich kopalń"
 WML_mining_in_lodz_desc:0 "Our voivodeship sits on a wealth of coal and other resources that we’re simply not mining fast and well enough. We’ve drawn up investment plans meant to modernize and expand our mines, using the cash we’ve gained from our recent industrial successes. This bounty of basic materials will fuel our rapidly expanding industry and surely give it the boost it needs to be the powerhouse our people expect it to be."

 WML_construction_of_parks:0 "Budowa parków"
 WML_construction_of_parks_desc:0 "The Scout’s ideology claims that cities are unnatural and something that’s directly opposite to nature, which they love all so much. We have come up with a solution to this issue however; there is a whole lot of unused space, or run down buildings that could be turned into new beautiful parks. This would without a doubt not only make our new partners very happy, but it would also pull eyes away from the sore thumb that’s the Bałuty Exclusion Zone."

 WML_scout_commandos:0 "Harcerscy komandosi"
 WML_scout_commandos_desc:0 "The ruthless upbringing and training routine in the Scouts’ ranks has caused them to be highly disciplined and skilled soldiers. We could adapt some of their methods to better teach our own Commandos how things are done. Ontop of that, older scouts could be integrated into our Special Forces' ranks as leaders and teachers."

 WML_spartan_standards:0 "Spartańskie standardy"
 WML_spartan_standards_desc:0 "As with our army, we must implement rigor and discipline into the lives of our population. We cannot enable the spread of cancerous decadence through our state’s body. Facing reality and adapting our lives to the issues facing us after the Fall instead of pretending that Poland never fell apart around must be our top priority, no matter how harsh the means."

 WML_lily_agents:0 "Agenci Szarej Lilijki"
 WML_lily_agents_desc:0 "Let’s face it, the City Guard that enforces our authority is more than incompetent. A sweeping reform of its apparatus is a possibility, however it would be a time-consuming and very costly endeavor given its current state. The Scouts however have reached out to us with a proposal. They suggest we allow their Gray Lilies to operate within our territories. This elite rank of enforcers, while harsh and even considered oppressive by some, if given a less authoritarian makeover will do wonders in replacing our current defunct system."

 WML_fantastical_lodz:0 "Łódź wśród Elfów"
 WML_fantastical_lodz_desc:0 "Duke Sapkowski may not have as many forces as the other militaristic factions, but his influence and popularity simply cannot go unnoticed. Thanks to his works (and games that were based on them) he gained world-wide fame and taking a slice of that fame for ourselves would surely help with our public opinion and our men’s morale."

 WML_ignacy_moscicki_potions_laboratory:0 "Laboratoria Eliksirów Ignacego Mościckiego"
 WML_ignacy_moscicki_potions_laboratory_desc:0 "With most modern foodstuffs being filled with artificial ingredients and preservatives, it might be profitable to centralize chemical production for all industries in single-purpose factories. This also gives us the perfect opportunity to experiment with chemicals which are not usually employed in the food industry, and seek for the new generation of combat drugs fit for a modern battlefield. The health risks of whatever we concoct aren’t a top priority though."

 WML_wizardring_schools:0 "Szkoły czarodziejów"
 WML_wizardring_schools_desc:0 "It is said any technology advanced enough is undistinguishable from magic... or maybe it's the other way. Anyway, it is about time we get back to education and start creating a new caste of elite thinkers and engineers with help of our new friends."

 WML_witcher_training:0 "Trening wiedźmina"
 WML_witcher_training_desc:0 "We really would waste the naming potential if we didn't name our special forces Witchers. Truth be told, the only thing stopping us was the copyright. With Duke Andrzej's consent, we can freely go ahead calling our commandos Witchers, so long as they have some knightley flair. We’ll just give them a service saber or something."

 WML_support_of_landowners:0 "Wsparcie właścicieli ziemskich"
 WML_support_of_landowners_desc:0 "Landowners are vital for the survival of the farming industry, and we have to care for them appropriately, both economically and symbolically. With the help of right-wing Sapkowski's supporters, we will grant a number of legal concessions to the landowners that will help them develop their businesses. The traditionalists will also make sure the society will treat them with respect they are due for their labor."

 WML_fairer_lodz:0 "Łódź wśród fanatyków religijnych"
 WML_fairer_lodz_desc:0 "Devotion in a cause. The main driving force behind any ideal, the burning embers of fervor deep within someone. That’s one thing that the Hooligans of Widzew have more than enough of. Their unending belief in their crusade of sorts to reclaim Łódź is a great cause for concern. However, what if we let them in peacefully? They’ll reclaim their New Canaan, and we’ll gain a lot of favor with them, not to mention the aid of their zealous ranks of bat wielding roughnecks."

 WML_the_primacy_of_entrepreneurs:0 "Łódź wśród biznesmenów"
 WML_the_primacy_of_entrepreneurs_desc:0 "Krośniewice’s Triumvirate is simply swimming in money. Money which we’d be very glad to take a slice out of. While they’re not the most popular candidate, their financial power and close ties with the medical services make them a very alluring option, especially among the richer folks within our leadership. After all, their expertise in fields like medicine, investigation… and burials of all things, would make them a very useful partner."
 WML_the_rights_of_religious_minorities:0 "Prawa mniejszości religijnych"

 WML_the_rights_of_religious_minorities_desc:0 "Jews, Muslims, Protestants and everyone else exist within our country and there’s no denying it. A motion pushed forward by the Hooligans that meant to grant Judaism equal status to Catholicism has spiraled into a discussion about broader tolerance of faith within our state. When the dust settled, it seems that everyone had agreed to grant equal rights to all religions and beliefs within Łódź."

 WML_primacy_of_trade_unions:0 "Prymat związków zawodowych"
 WML_primacy_of_trade_unions_desc:0 "Trade Union presence in Łódzkie has been abnormally low just about everywhere. We see the issue with that, or well, saw when half of our workers held a general strike against us. To prevent such further issues, the Hooligans have reached out to us with an offer to help spread awareness of active unions and establish new ones where they were lacking."

 WML_co_-_financing_of_sports:0 "Dotacje na imprezy sportowe"
 WML_co_-_financing_of_sports_desc:0 "The Hooligans love soccer. They love it above everything else and it can prove a very good bargaining chip in negotiations with them. If we invest some money into invigorating the sports industry in Łódź and especially in Old Widzew, we’d get a lot of favor from Rabbi and his crew of goons."

 WML_defenders_of_faith:0 "Obrońcy wiary"
 WML_defenders_of_faith_desc:0 "While Rabbi might not have much to offer in terms of actual military capabilities, his “coaches” may very well serve as an often forgotten part of warfare: Chaplains. Their contribution to soldiers’ morale through sermons and kind words in trying times has been seen time and time again, even if they rarely get the credit for it. Our soldiers will thank us for having ones of our own to support them."

 WML_preferential_government_contracts:0 "Kontrakty rządowe"
 WML_preferential_government_contracts_desc:0 "Financial support granted to us by the Consortium has allowed us to sign some brand new contracts with weapons manufacturers. This will finally allow us to arm out troops with real, modern weapons. Our forces will look more like an actual army, instead of a bunch of reservists with one rifle and half a magazine for five men."

 WML_tax_breaks:0 "Ulgi podatkowe"
 WML_tax_breaks_desc:0 "Business in our city won’t simply grow up and out of the cracks in the sidewalk on its own, that’s why we need to give it a helping hand. Lowering taxes will be like a flower pot full of fresh, well fertilized earth which will lead to the blooming of the beautiful blossoms of commerce all across Łódź. Soon we’ll have a whole bouquet of new companies and enterprises for our people to enjoy."

 WML_graves_of_an_unknown_soldier:0 "Groby Nieznanych Żołnierzy"
 WML_graves_of_an_unknown_soldier_desc:0 "The return of the funeral home “H. Skrzydlewska” to Łódź has been a hidden boon, not only in a commercial sense, but also for uplifting the spirits of our citizens. They can bury their dead family members in a proper, ceremonial manner once again. Let’s just hope we have enough space in our graveyards."
 WML_private_security_agencies:0 "Prywatne agencje ochrony"

 WML_private_security_agencies_desc:0 "While the City Guard has been doing a... decent job, optimistically speaking, we need a gentler touch for cases that they’re simply not skilled enough for. We can’t expect a group of so-called officers who can barely dish out a parking ticket to actually catch a criminal that knows the basics of how to cover their tracks.For this exact reason we’ve decided to officially integrate Rutkowski’s agency into our law enforcement structure."

Łódź has many problems, more than just the Five Problems and we need to go about fixing or mitigating them in any way possible. There’s no rush though, after all if we play our cards right, the warlords will solve a big chunk of our problems for us."

 WML_hold_onto_normality_desc: "The illusion of normality we try our best to hold up is a  very fragile thing, and as times change, upkeeping it becomes a more and more strenuous task. Our latest overtures to the warlords have probably been one of the biggest strains on that illusion thus far. However, through some gentle web weaving and a few sensible explanations, we can simply frame these communications as a normal part of Post-Fall politics."

 WML_crackdown_on_consoomers_desc: "Łódź has long been called “The Den of Decadence” and its name is sadly not without merit. With people living like the Fall had never happened, telling them that some commodities are in short supply is practically impossible, with us having to operate within black markets behind their backs to get them their coveted bottle of wine from Bydgoszcz. This has to end, or we’ll become so reliant on the black market, it will barely be what it’s meant to be. Limiting some of the highest “luxuries” will be a step in the right direction."

 WML_pamper_delegations_desc: "Now, we want a good look for ourselves in the eyes of our soon to be allies and one way to do that is to get them to look at Łódź through rose tinted glasses. The other warlords’ representatives will be given the highest standard of living possible in our city, as if they weren’t getting it before. Free passes into spas, the best smuggled alcohol we have and just about anything else we can come up with to make their stay here as pleasant as possible. They’ll love it here, and hopefully they’ll recommend their experience to their peers."

 WML_ultimate_compromise_desc: "The balancing act we’ve been showing off to everyone has been interpreted in many different ways, a masterstroke of diplomacy, bootlicking and so on and so forth. Though few can deny its effectiveness. Through our inventiveness we have managed to accrue favors with just about everyone around us and it’s time to turn them in for real assurances of good terms between us."

 WML_send_final_letters_desc: "The Conference’s date is nearly upon us and there’s no time to wait. Letters and delegations have been sent. Soon we’ll see the fruits of our labor. We will prepare the finest reception for all the leaders, a banquet at the best restaurants, comfortable lodging in the most expensive hotels and any amenity they could imagine for the duration of their stay. We’re all crossing our fingers hoping for the best."

 WML_hold_great_conference_desc: "The day we have all been waiting for has come. The Great Conference. The fate of Łódzkie hangs in the balance as everyone completes the final preparations to host the other warlords’ heads’ of state and their ministers. We have come this far and we can’t afford to trip up now."

 ####INCOMPLETE COMPROMISE FOCUS TREE####

 WML_incomplete_compromise:0 "Partial Success at the Conference"
 WML_incomplete_compromise_desc:0 "Well, that could’ve gone better. It seems that despite our best efforts, we managed to sway only a few of the warlords to our side, which means only one thing: War is on the horizon. We are wholly unprepared for a conflict at this time, having put all of our resources into ensuring the Dialogue’s success. It was all for nothing it seems. Now all we have is a confused population, and an even more confused army. We have to scramble to fix whatever we can right now."

 WML_coalition_of_necesity_desc: "The best we can do is at least act on our promises. Group up and form an alliance. Strength in numbers is the only thing that can save us now because that is all that we have left. It is both a boon and curse, granting us a force that seemingly could crush just about anyone... Well, just seemingly..."

 WML_wrangle_those_loyal_to_us_desc: "Enough is enough, our coalition cannot go on if everyone tries to do their own separate thing. We’ll need to “coerce” the governments of our new friends into following our lead a bit closer than they have thus far. They’ll still have a say in what they decide to do... just a bit less so."

 WML_chaos_in_our_ranks_desc: "Our armies do not know what to do. Who is our enemy? Who is our friend? Who do we shoot and who do we not? Nobody is sure and that’s not even the worst part. The sheer amount of differences in doctrine and army makeup across the coalition’s states have made it utter hell to form any sort of organized military effort."

 WML_conflicted_soldiers_desc: "Just weeks ago, everyone was yelling at each other, calling themselves the true heirs of Łódzkie and that everyone else was just a usurper, but now all of a sudden they all have to put aside their differences? This has unfortunately led to mounting tension between all of our soldiers, who have had a hard time letting go of the rhetoric preached by their leaders up until just recently, often leading to heated arguments or even full on fights.\nWe have to do something about this if we intend to have even a remnant of a functioning standing army."

 WML_commanders_in_turmoil_desc: "It seems that even higher military staff is corruptible by the old ideals of their cliques. They may not get into brawls with their the rest of the staff, but they take every possible opportunity to attempt to “humiliate” their peers, or undermine eachother's efforts. Much like the privates however, they cannot help but throw vicious remarks at each other. If they don’t get along, then how will they serve as a shining example for their subordinates?"

 WML_bring_order_to_chaos_desc: "It’s time to stop, okay?! From now on we’ll be dishing out harsh reprimands to both commanders and troops on the ground, scaling in severity based on rank. They will act like adults, or they will be mopping the latrines until their backs snap like toothpicks. We didn’t want it to come to this, but it seems that this is the only language these morons understand."

 WML_coordinate_our_war_bureaus_desc: "Now that our soldiers are behaving somewhat, we can work on getting our forces' heads of staff to click together in an orderly manner. Creating one unified army command is a step in that direction. Their headquarters will be in Łódź (of course) and they’ll still command the forces of their respective states, this time in tandem with the others however."

 WML_refurbish_old_trucks_desc: "Stockpiles of vehicles that were once used by the army lay scattered around warehouses in Łódź and we have made the decision to put them back into circulation. The need for faster deployment and better logistics has become a must, now that a war is looming over the horizon. Let’s hope we don’t have to start confiscating civilian vehicles though."

 WML_polish_our_military_tactics_desc: "As Łódź up until now relied mostly on the City Guard and miniscule remnants of the territorial forces to defend our city from looters, bandits and ordinary criminals that pop up from time to time, however to call these forces an army would be simply laughable. We’ll be organizing proper training courses for our troops, so they know which side of their rifles to shoot out from, and which colored outfits to not aim at."

 WML_call_upon_reservists_desc: "Guns with no one to shoot them, that’s the sad state of our armed forces. Everywhere else in Łódzkie, and probably the rest of Poland the opposite is true. We’ve done our best to avoid ramping up our militarization policy up until now, however in times like these we need everyone we can afford. Anyone who had received proper military training before the Fall will be called up to serve in our hodge podge “army” if it can even be called that."

 WML_fighting_the_good_fight_desc: "A conflict is inevitable, and everyone knows that. That’s why we need everyone to be on board when the time comes. We will frame the upcoming conflict as a war of good and evil. The humble and peaceful supporters of Łódź being assailed by evil incarnate, bringers of death and all kinds of treachery. A real story of David and Goliath… Well, that’s probably a bit overexaggerated, but they’ll get the point."

 WML_chaos_at_homefront_desc: "Our people are simply speaking confused, they don’t know who or what to believe, trust or put their faith in. Discontent is a great issue as some especially zealous cities have been crippled by strikes and protests  boycotting the formation of the coalition, and decrying the Dialogue as a failed project. This has only been hammered in by the chaos of unfinished, damaged and barricaded road networks, major energy fluctuations and all sorts of other issues seem to appear daily. We have to reverse this downward spiral now, or there won’t be any hope for Łódzkie."

 WML_haphazardly_merge_our_governance_desc: "Current politics in our alliance are one giant tug of war between factions. Our politicians are figuratively ripping each other apart during conferences and meetings, leading to nowhere. This can be temporarily fixed by merging the most agreeable and lenient parts of all our governments into an interim “wartime committee”. This choice is far from the best one, however it is the only solution we can put into motion in our very limited time before the inevitable conflict erupts."

 WML_pool_our_chips_desc: "Separately we all own just about nothing, but together we own a big chunk of the voivodeship. We cannot squander all this untapped potential, by putting all of our best men, our weapon caches and daily consumer products together. Everything in one place, ready to be used as need be. Nobody will hold out on others and make deals behind our backs. Only if we stand at the center of our Coalition's logistics and economy, we can all hold out."

 WML_rebuilding_the_cities_desc: "As much as we try to hide it, Łódź has not gone completely untouched during the Fall. We’ve managed to fix up or at least hide any noticeable ruins, disguising some as renovations and projects meant to “revitalize” our city. Our people may have gotten used to endless renovations before the Fall, but we cannot go on like this. All those scaffolding and rubble-catching net facades will be facades no longer as we’ll fund a wide reaching project to *actually* rebuild Łódź."

 WML_extra_pay_for_overtime_desc: "Our work schedules so far have been fairly lax, mostly staying as they were before the Fall as we did our best to avoid shattering the illusion of normality we’ve so carefully constructed. A solution has been brought to our attention by Marek Belka. We could give our workers greater incentives for working overtime in sectors that need stepping up the most. After all, who would mind working a few more hours for extra cash?"

 WML_sync_up_our_networks_desc: "Gas lines, water pipes, power lines, everything. Ever since the borders of what remains of the Łódzkie Voivodeship solidified, practically all networks were cut off from each other, both to save resources for ourselves, and to not help our potential enemies. Well, those choices that seemed so great at the time have come back to haunt us, as all of these basic necessities need to be connected up again. Setting up hundreds of new electric poles, laying groundwork for new pipes has become practically necessary to hold up the weight of our alliance. So, let’s get to work!"

 WML_connect_our_roads_desc: "The roads connecting our voivodeship have mostly fallen into disrepair in the years following the Fall. Gas for cars has become so scarce, that it has been only reserved for the military in most places leading to them becoming a ruined mess (not that big of a step up from what they were before the Fall though). Well, now we have to connect them all up, since we don’t really want to drive our trucks and direct civilians through the local farms and forests."

 WML_spread_propaganda_desc: "We should quell any concerns our people have about our coalition’s stability and wellbeing, and what better way is there to do so than good old propaganda. A few inspiring speeches, even simple flyers and posters go a long way in rallying people around a single cause. Our citizens will stand shoulder to shoulder, ready to brave through what may come in the future."

 WML_workers_of_frontlines_desc: "Workers in many regards are like soldiers. They work at the very bottom layers of our state, yet they contribute so much to it. They work jobs nobody would want to work for the benefit of our people. Our workers need to see their own worth to us. We’ll need them to be as motivated as possible in the next weeks and bits of encouragement like that will make all the difference."
 WML_we_did_our_best_desc: "Well, time’s up. The coalition formed to combat us is starting to gather on our borders. A pre-emptive strike is the only way we can get the upper hand on them now since our methods of fixing the issues troubling our state have for the most part failed. Let’s hope what we did was enough, because that’s all that we have left."

 WML_let_that_be_our_legacy_desc: "We did it! Despite all odds we beat back our enemies and managed to get the entire voivodeship under our control. The Dialogue has been proven successful, even if it was scarred in the process. Now, let’s rejoice and celebrate, our voivodeship is finally united again!"

 WML_total_dialogue_desc:0 "We’ve done it!\n\nThanks to Szymon Hołownia’s best efforts we’ve managed to unite the Łódź Voivodeship under one banner. The sheer fact we’ve managed to reach a compromise between all the region’s factions is simply impossible to comprehend, however now before us lies another great issue; managing this shaky at best alliance. Our solution for this problem is very simple on paper, integrating the highly clashing ideologies of our new allies into our governance, however in reality finding common threads between these entirely different nations will be a very time consuming and difficult process."

 WML_military_desc:0 "Our armies will stand hand in hand, shoulder to shoulder together on the front, behind enemy lines and on the homefront. The Scouts’ guerilla warfare will wreak havoc behind enemy lines, the Hooligans’ Warrior-Rabbis will lift our men’s spirits, the Duke’s valiant knights will make a show of their prowess, striking fear into the hearts of our enemies just as hard as their steel will clash against their armor.\nAll together we will be indomitable!"

 WML_economy_desc:0 "What’s the use in keeping our economies separate? If we are such great allies, then what’s stopping us from forming one united economic bloc. The might of our economy will be unlike any other. The Brotherhood’s immense industrial might, the Consortium’s unending wealth and the many workshops littering just about everywhere else will make us a true powerhouse among Poland’s squalor.\nWho could possibly stand up to us then?"

 WML_system_desc:0 "Finally, Łódź can return to being our region’s hotbed of democracy. All sorts of ideologies, ideals and ways of thought all in one place, not in strife but in relative harmony. People from every corner of our voivodeship fill our streets to the brim. Families and groups long separated have the chance to unite again, much like us and these warlords.\nIn the end, we’ve finally become friends with everyone."

 WML_unify_lodzkie_power_grid_desc: "Ever since Poland descended into anarchy, coming across any area with power that doesn’t go out every two hours and has to be shut off at night was more fantastical than Sapkowski’s books. Most of this instability has arisen from a tactic of resource warfare that has quickly spread across the nation: cutting power lines and knocking down electric poles. Well, that was all well and good, until everyone decided to not be at eachothers’ throats as much. In collaboration with the Brotherhood, the City’s board has decided to fix any gaps in our power supply chain.\n\nWe’ll need so many electricians..."

 WML_crushing_our_carbon_footprint_desc: "Clouds of dense, putrid smog spill out of the Brotherhood's territories down south from our city, making life in certain areas inconvenient at best, or practically inhospitable at worst. Now, since the Sphere of Dialogue gives all the warlords more or less equal political sway in the region, the Scouts have been demanding that the Brotherhood limit their use of the black gold, and to tear down their factories. An outcome that is in all possibilities frankly impossible. However a compromise solution has been reached: The Brotherhood will be made to equip their copious amounts of coal burning facilities with air filters and try their best to optimize their use of coal, instead of dumping whole truck loads to turn on a lightbulb. We’ll also focus more on green energy, to lower the Voivodeship’s reliance on the Bełchatów Power Plant for most of its power, cutting down on coal use by proxy."

 WML_fields_of_flowers_desc: "The Scouts' deurbanisation efforts and forester lifestyle have allowed even the most delicate flora to thrive in their lands. Everywhere across ZHP-controlled turf, groves of naturally-growing elderberries, early dog-violets, bear leeks and even lilies of the valley spring up from the forest undergrowth. These forest flower fields immediately caught the attention of Skrzydlewski, who proposed the foundation of flower plantations growing species imported from forests belonging to the Scouts. As was expected, the Scouts (despite Duda's initial approval of the project) rejected such attempts at industrialising their land's natural beauty, but that doesn't mean that Skrzydlewski's initial idea should go to waste. \n\nThus we propose: a joint ZHP-Skrzydlewska H. forest flower cultivation programme that combines the Scouts' natural methods and Skrzydlewska H.'s expertise." #to pewnie dało by się lepiej zrobić ehhh

 WML_new_lodzermensch_desc: "Łódź owes much of its character and impressive textile industry to the large Jewish population that created much of the city as we know it from the ground up. However that is no longer the case as the Holocaust made sure to leave no trace of the once thriving community. However, thanks to a common incentive between us and Widzew’s government, we will try our best to revive the culture and customs of Łódź’s jewry. Rebuilding synagogues, making active efforts to reconnect families that still remain in our Voivodeship and giving large donations to NGOs that managed to survive the Fall and many other incentives will be put into action to ensure we succeed at our goal."

 WML_caravans_of_death_desc: "Skrzydlewski and Co.'s clique is heavily centered around earning money through people dying - to the point where their entire 'state' apparatus is built to maximize the amount of bodies that can be lowered into the ground and gutted up for organ trade. If we were to incorporate their territories without keeping the Paramedics' and Skrzydlewski's blood business intact, their sixth of the Voivodeship would immediately nosedive economically, turning the entire area into a financial ball-and-chain, dragging down our posibilities and resources - therefore, their operation has to be perserved. \n\n...Aaaaaand if we are to incorporate their shady dealings into our own state, we might as well openly join it and secure a share of the profits for our government's purposes."

 WML_paladins_in_shining_armor_desc: "The Brotherhood’s Paladins, the upper echelons of their leadership, are Paladins in name only. They may flaunt their title and status, but what do they have to show for it?\n\nDo they have gorgeous armor with depictions of their allegiance?\n\nDo they strike fear into the eyes of their enemies?\n\nWell, now they definitely do! Along with their new somewhat regal getup, they will lead an elite force of so-called Coal Marines. We’re not exactly sure what they’re supposed to be, but the planner from Ellander seemed thrilled about the idea, so we gave it the go ahead."

 WML_creating_real_witchers_desc: "Witchers - something that seems so incredible and fantastical. Well, to everyone but Ebrantil and his crew of Paramedics. Nobody is quite sure why he became so captivated by them, however such inspiration has through some “Top Secret” means yielded results which are eerily similar to their depictions within the franchise; Genetic mutation which is potentially lethal to those affected. If not for Duke Sapkowski and his subordinates taking an interest in the project, we would’ve shut it down, despite Ebrantil assuring us of such cases being only “unforeseen allergic reactions”, or “unrelated medical conditions”. We’ve begrudgingly agreed to keep the operation running.\n\nIf it makes them happier..."

 WML_carbon_based_stimulants_desc: "Activated Carbon, Steroids, Methamphetamines, the list goes on. A whole slurry of narcotics and… coal? This horrible concoction was the brainchild of Brotherhood Scientists, and of course, Ebrantil. Who else would deliver every combat stimulant in the books under the guise of a relief to an upset stomach.\n\nIs it safe?\nNobody knows!\n\nBut it’s hard to ignore his ingenuity and skill of making every instance of overstepping the law, or making a mockery of the Hippocratic Oath, sound justified. Though due to immense pressure from both the Consortium and Brotherhood, we’ll roll out these stimulants. For the good of our army."

 WML_mossad_branch_desc: "Ever since 14th century, the Polish jewry was the go-to solution for problems requiring a refined hand. Once they were about trade. Even now, after the Nazi onslaught of 20th century and 21st century's collapse, there are Jews in Poland... and their fans. Judeophilic Widzew's wisest ultras and their rabbi's, the zealotry and eccentrism aside, were some of the most cunning denizens of Łódź. For anything requiring a hand that can be as much Jewish velvet as an ultra's clenched fist, for enemies without and within, Mossad lies in prowl. The city wakes, and we are not alone. Beneath their eye, our dissidents will only count dreams."
 WML_scoiatael_rangers_desc: "'You're late. Also one of you is sick or took something' -  \n 'How do you know?' \n 'He's hyperventilating like a boar' \n The Scoia'tael, if they had a single thought in their minds, would think they saw a nicely dressed toy soldier that had no business being so well groomed in the middle of the forest. And yet here he was, after one hour of marching, looking like it was nothing to him. Scoia'tael meanwhile, cautiously optimistic about the prospect of co-working with the Scouts, looked like they knew everything about the forest... and nothing about hairdressing. But, inevitabely, they would be taught Scout discipline and devotion. The Grey Lilies were the best drillmasters around. And they could learn Scoia'tael ingenuity as well."

 WML_what_now_desc: "Now that the dust has settled, the absolute state of the situation we have found ourselves in has become apparent. We are now in charge of babysitting not only our city, but also five warlords who collectively want to tear each others’ throats out. This chaotic state of affairs has left not only us, but also our new partners confused. We need to capitalize off this madness, before anyone else snaps out of their haze.\n\nThere will be no half-measures in the Voivodeship of Total Dialogue."

 WML_accursed_wiechowszczyzna_desc: "The Wiechowszczyzna come out of the forest in the ZHP areas, and with their words, yearning for atom followed. Atom! The same power that blew up Chernobyl and Łódź itself! The Dialogue is fragile. Too fragile. But it's all we have. We didn’t manage to please everyone, heh, we couldn't please anyone really, but IT WORKED! And every new splinter movement, means ever greater division. We have no place for atom fetishists. Even the our talk about carbon capture does not warm up the Brotherhood nearly enough, must we also suffer the atom-fetishists? No. We need to initiate the Dialogue... that ends with them fucking off."

 WML_launch_the_tvl_desc: "'TVŁ: Łodzian voice up your arse' \n CUT \n 'You can't just have everything up your arse anymore, we have a TV station to launch! \n 'Eh, I guess you can always try take me to football matches and for kebab, till my ass will only be used for shitting' \n Urban could not believe that in his golden years he was going to be conscripted for TV station. The Dialogue compelled, the heart said 'fight on', but the expenses bill said 'Let's make some money.' \n 'We got you all the raises you asked for, but if you keep being a grumpy boomer, I have a number for Tadeusz Rydzyk ready. \n 'Old bluff. They scared me with him 4 times and look at us now' - Urban was not relenting just yet. \n 'In that case' - the interepid aide of the new TV station dialed up - 'Seven, seven, seven, and seven. SELECT.' \n 'Offices of Tadeusz Rydzyk, God bless?' \n 'WAIT!' - Urban yelled as loud as he could. \n 'Mmmmm... MATTHEW 6:24, pass it on!' - he hung up. \n 'Get me an extra presenter for whem I tire too much, and i promise you, no more shenanigans or delays.' \n 10 days later, one of the most precious items in Łódź, a working TV, displayed the half-serious face of a small fat gnome-like man. With his elephant ears, he spoke clearly and slowly: 'Welcome to TVŁ, Dialogue's voice in your house. And image too. In today's news, you will be given the same perspective as your erstwhile foes, whether you watch from underground, a foresh shack, or get it transcribed from a street herald. I for one... to be honest, couldn't be bothered. You could say I died with the last Polish state. But here I am, just like you, to pay my bills. At last you can relate to your news anchor! Now for the news...'" 

 WML_cervantes_institute_desc: "Listening to the likes of Bartyzel, in-depth studies of Don Quixote of La Mancha, windmill combat, poetic Renaissance writing. These and then some, are Cervantes Institute activities. How do they even contribute to the insurmountable challenge of the Dialogue? Well, the Dialogue involves binding radically deranged and different warlords together in one union. It seems like fighting windmills... exactly something you could consult *El ingenioso Hidalgo Don Quixote de la Mancha* with. Our own homegrown Polish Quixotism is born here: we need all the reference material we can."

 WML_YAHWEHCON_desc: "Our story begins in the Old Testament, but it is no longer just told in churches and synagogues. Modern problems require modern solutions. Enter YahwehCon: It *is* a four-letter word here, which is our LORD. Whatsoever you wanted to hear about God, Jesus, Widzew mythos, you can now hear from a rising Christ reenactor tradition, rivalled only by Filipino one. Of course, the most limelight is claimed by Abraham and Old Testament, as well as the twelve hooligan bands of Israel and twelve tribes of Widzew. Wait, did I mixed something up? Oh well. Better get back there to refresh the memory!"


 WML_unite_the_abrahamic_faiths_desc: "There is no doubt that Szymon Hołownia values peace and stability above all other political principles. No one should then be surprised about the most recent move made by the so-called Lord of Dialogue. From now on, believers of the largest monotheist religions rejoice in unity that has been granted in our precious state. Judaism, Christianity and Islam have been brought together in relative harmony, which was enabled by hard work spearheaded by our best theologians. Although the other warlords all around are looking at us with shock in their eyes, we won’t be bothered by such childish acts. We have done what was right, and religious unity has been ensured.\n\nLet it endure forever!"


 WML_lodzkie_cultural_hodgepodge_desc: "Together, the followers of Hołownia form an omnipresent inexorable force, of myriad thoughts from all corenrs of the Voivodeship... and soon the world. An idea bigger than all of them combined: A place where people of all creeds and ideas can coexist, a mirage of the days before the Fall, according to Hołownia's soul. Where you could speak Yiddish to God, eat kebab with two swords at your back, and stay the night in the forest in a Brotherhood-made carbon-fibre sleeping bag, and call that carbon-neutral. And according to his mind, a prophecy of the nation's rebirth. The divisions between peoples were heralds of  bloodbaths. Indeed, the greater the good involed, the more ferocious the evil. But Hołownia feels that there is no greater force than the people from all around the world fused into a single city and soon, a nation. For bringing them all together was an achievement very few nations could do truly well. Hołownia was a chance for Poland to do it again, and be reborn into diversity that truly is strength for the nation, not an empty dogma.

They thought bringing Sapkowski and Widzew hooligans together, ZHP and Coal brothers, was impossible. They told us we were mad to try. Well, why won’t they go talk to their own asses, as they always did, these experts, pundits, and armchair diplomats?! Because we did it. A meme slogan and a singular devotion to conflict de-escalation and diplomacy. We had nothing but that, and it was more than enough. This will cascade on.

 WML.1.desc:0 "It was the little things in Łódź that made guests smile. \n\nThe rattling and screeching of the trams, filled with bored people looking into their smartphones. \n\nCars in a traffic jam on a narrow street, honking, driven by people looking dead inside. \n\nA reactivated vagina-shaped fountain, bubbling ceaselessly and splashing water, much to the joy of children walking by it to preschool, much to the embarrassment of their caretakers. \n\nFull tables in bars and restaurants, people chattering carelessly while sharing foods and drinks. \n\nThose rushing to work – and sporting some wear formal enough to make the onlooker sure they weren't *just* office workers, but office professionals. \n\nJuvenile delinquents with enough decency left to resort to enjoying beer on a nice afternoon. \n\nA vague demonstration in front of city hall, consisting of one art school girl, two of her friends, her how-do-you-do-fellow-kids aunt and that one basement-dwelling guy who heard about it on the internet and thought there'd be a show. \n\nSeen through the eyes of a native, these images could seem superficial and banal. But a visitor from other parts of the Polish Anarchy, having seen the city simply functioning, with its blood pumping and breathing palpable, could not help but wish they could spend some more time in that freeze-frame of an early 2020s (para)documentary."

We can't afford to scare them away. \n - Mr. Belka's right. We could use the revenue to renovate the buildings.\n - Do we even have a functioning judicial branch to oversee wheather those taxes would be lawful?\nHołownia couldn't even distinguish who said what after listening to yet another quarrell among his ministers. He was hoping that by gathering various Łódź specialists with different political backgrounds would result in compromise and the best ideas would emerge. He still believed that to be true, but he needed to be a more decisive leader as a more laid-back approach as the moderator and listener ended with them bickering constantly. When Hołownia raised his hand the clangor stopped.\n - Ladies and gentlemen, this cannot continue. We didn't achieve anything meaningful in last months and the strom in Łódzkie is coming, unless we do something. While I respect your counsel, from now on the final decision about the direction of our state will belong to me.\n - But... - Gill-Piątek tried to oppose.\n - No buts - Hołownia interrupted sternly - Soon we will deliberate on the most important questions regarding our very survival. As of now we have to think what to do with the incoming sudents' protest."

 WML.3.t:0 "A look into the Horizon"
 WML.3.desc:0 "'Today, we rise through hardship to stars. Today, we enter a new era of plenty and another step on the stairway back to heaven. Today, I declare this... NAIL FACTORY OPEN!' \nYes, Hołownia could hype people up over anything, including an opening of an unremarkable shack-like warehouse where a bunch of scavenged machines casted nails out of molten metal stream. Connected to a foundry, this thing was supposed to bring about nails of all sizes for construction and restoration detail. \n And guess what. That, was progress. From scavenging, to manufacturing, to unified Poland, to an entire new way of manufacturing. Whenever he was out in the city by himself, he would take a closer look at Łódź’s citizens, and at the city itself. He wanted to contrast the experience of being there in the thick of it with his usual political affairs concerning Łódź. Surveying the streets, and the events taking place on them, allowed the President to better understand the problems his people were facing. Because of this, the feelings that were usually with him during his trips to the city were those of uncertainty and concern. But today was different. He realised that today he has seen far fewer symbols of political polarisation than usual. Not only that, when he looked towards the horizon, he could see smoke coming from the chimneys of factories and power plants. Even the streets themselves seemed more lively, and the people happier. At that moment, he had finally noticed that his hard work was paying off. It wasn’t just about securing survival for the citizens of the Free City. Another duty which had rested on Hołownia’s shoulders was making sure everyone finds common ground within the dialogue sphere, and after years of work, it finally looked like the foundations for a dialogue-driven Poland had been laid. Even at that very moment he could see that civil discussion was prevalent. So many people, participating in the noble art of dialogue despite their differences, and putting aside their selfish desires for the sake of the greater good. It made him feel very different emotions from before - pride and relief. But he knew pride to be a false friend. All of Poland did ever since the Fall.  President Szymon Hołownia had greater plans. And he was well aware that if he was ever to achieve those plans, he’d have to keep on looking forward, because resting on his laurels would undoubtedly doom his government and the people who had trust in it. He could not allow that, and so, with newfound determination, he promised himself never to doubt his mission, and lead the citizens of Łódź, and eventually Poland towards a better future.\nThis country will be a phoenix from the ashes, as will this city. Hołownia's will, doing the impossible time and time again, will forevermore accelerate this country from humble nailed-cast beginnings, to the stars. But first, we'll have to produce bullets in similar way..."

 WML.4.t:0 "Searching for an Energy Source"
 WML.4.desc:0 "– To put it bluntly, Mr President, we’re in deep shit – said the engineer, wiping sweat off his forehead. – Each day number of flats disconnected from electricity grows exponentially, and we can only be happy spring’s coming and days are getting longer. Most of public venues already use emergency generators. Price of fuel grows with each day. Yesterday I’ve had to scrap off the floor seven guys. Six of them, they tried to leech off the grid on their own, and the seventh – electrician's face turned pale – installed makeshift water turbine in his toilet. It’s only a matter of days until some bloke from the Faculty of Physics builds a nuclear reactor and we'll have to deal with another Zone. \n\n– Couldn’t we just have a sincere talk with them how dangerous it is? – asked Hołownia. Katarzyna Lubnauer shook her head. \n– We can’t let people know how bad things really are. We either act and tell them what’s the solution right now, or... \n– But do we really know the solution? – Szymon rolled his eyes. \n\n– This electric palace I see in front of me is the Łódź oldest power plant – Tomasz Zimoch actually looked into Hołownia’s eyes, but it didn’t matter  – its chimneys, like high masts of a majestic sailing ship, will carry us out of this storm, and you, you Mr President, you will be the captain, the one to bring power like Prometheus brough fire to miserable Greeks... \n\n– Mr. Zimoch, if you please – Marek Belka interrupted – why would we try to bring old, decrepit power plants back to life, when we can easily make a deal with the Brotherhood? They have enough coal, and, thus, enough energy to fulfill all our needs. \n\nHołownia pondered for a while. \n– Fly, fly Adaś, fly over the atomic debris! – shouted Zimoch."

 WML.5.desc:0 "– They don’t even care anymore in that Chinese place – sighed Lubnauer, putting bags filled with takeout boxes on the table. Famished by hours of debates, Hołownia reached quickly for the bag, grabbed the first box and dug into fried rice with a plastic fork. A Sharp and somewhat putrid smell filled the hall. \n– What’s this? – asked Belka, lifting his box up to sniff the contents and see it closely. \n– Fried rice with pigeon – Lubnauer replied. In a silent room, a single slow and loud gulp could be heard, followed by coughing. \n\n– I’m so glad I’m vegan – said Gill-Piątek, taking her box out of the bag. – Why would anyone buy this shit in the first place? \n– This is the last Chinese bar in the city that did not rise prices – replied Lubnauer. – And the line was atrocious. That’s the only semblance of the old food people can still afford. \n– It  d o e s  taste similar – Hołownia remarked. – Guess we should’ve drawn the line when kebabs stopped pretending the lamb was actually beef. \n– Haven’t we got any other food options? – asked Belka. \n– It’s for the envoy – replied Lubnauer, as a large, quite hairy and quite smelly individual entered the room. \n\n– Oh shit, Chinese takeout?! – exclaimed the neckbeard, stomping towards the table. – None of these survived in Ellander. Anyways – he continued with his mouth full – we could supply you with some fresh produce from our estates. You know, meat, milk, mead, some grains and veggies, so on. \n– Maybe we’ve got some alternatives... – Hołownia muttered, looking at the numerous flock of pigeons behind the window. \n– Yeah, coal, matzah or pinecones – replied the neckbeard. – You’ll be better off with us. Although, judging by this, there’s nothing wrong with your food..."

 WML.6.desc:0 "–...It’s not like the industry fared any much better, I must admit – Marek Belka pointed at a pie chart of dubious quality, made most likely just as something to point at – but right now, when we could and should become an industrial powerhouse in this shithole of a country, all of that went straight into the dumpster. As an isolated urban area, we’ve traveled back to the times of cottage industry and 90’s unemployment simultaneously. We can’t build new houses without scavenging through the rubble, we can’t print books without recycling old ones, we can’t service our army, our public institutions, our… \n\n– I get the point – Hołownia interrupted. – Why aren't we importing anything yet? Won’t any of our neighbors like to make a profit? \n– These loonies are at eachother’s throats – replied Lubnauer. – We have to place our trust carefully and pick the most profitable and sensible option. Either way they’re gonna notice we trade with their enemies and we won’t gain shit. \n\n– Let’s discuss the possibilities, then – concluded Hołownia briskly, but the response wasn’t really enthusiastic. \n– There’s only one possibility here – said Belka resignedly. – The Consortium is the only statelet with an industrial base capable enough and appropriate attitude. We should contact them ASAP. \n\nHołownia’s eyes became glassy. – Why can’t we simply... just... get along with each other! – he cried. – It’s something we can all benefit from! They know it for sure! No matter how dumb or crazy they are! Even if they’d plan to kill us later, they just have to see that, for now, the Dialogue is the best solution! Just a moment of peace in this God forsaken pigsty of a country! Why they don’t understand? n\n\The room fell silent. Gil Piątek approached Hołownia and embraced him. \n– Don’t worry, Szymon. We’ll have enough time to fork them over. We’ll just have to wait for some things to unfold..."

What the ambassadors forgot about, is that the Brotherhood was perfectly fine mining coal just to see the aggregates pile up. In fact, their loss prevention was flimsy when it came to the black goodness they mined. And getting them into the same polity as the Scouts was truly excrutiating. \n 'Tell you what, we'll just call up Duda, and we'll renegotiate when he's our Minister of Energy.' - the city's Qui-Gon lookalike said. Turns out friendship is as valuable as magic when the other side things their erstwhile enemies are beating them to it.

Alas, he was barely recognized by the big, bearded envoy of the Duchy, who looked like he swallowed an entire barrel of beer. \n 'Of course. We will be happy to receive the ambassadors. As you know, however, it is perfectly required to first proclaim ALL the titles of our Duke. And his cabinet too.' \n 'Won't that take impractically...' \n 'Long?

The envoy of Łódź city watched the whole thing slightly flabbergasted. \n 'I have a bad feeling about this' - the envoy confessed to his peer, an older man with a ponytail.' \n 'I don't sense anything' - the Qui-Gon wannabe replied. \n 'It's not the mission, it's something else, elusive.' \n 'Well duh, we're about to negotiate with a drunkard and veteran of domestic violence. Don't center on your anxieties, Zenobi. I need you focused. Drunkards are cowards deep down... the negotiations will be short. \n He was right about one thing; The negotiations were short. The drunkard, elevated rather than crippled by his vodka, caught them offguard and ferociously wheeled and dealed with everything according to his and Duchy's needs. Which mostly meant that from now on, Ellander was a priority target for most of the city's vodka production, everything nominal, titular and official appeared to be in the Duchy's favor, whilst in truth, as crafted by the ponytail negotiator, The Free City has secured pretty much everything it needed and then some. The Treaty of Moskwa was a resounding success, and the Dialogue’s newly joined Duke had one more reason for revelry."

Assuming the scouts were going to show up, as the delegation couldn't see anyone for a while. Then a pinecone dropped at their feet. They could see 3 juveniles, one man in grey uniform, and another in green. \n 'Let me get this straight, you want us to halt all development in the city and see to it that half of our populace goes to the woods?' \n The greenshirt made an equivalent of left-wing meme's literary content in support of his terms, and with similar substance too. Throughout the tirade, the greyshirt just grinned eerily, and the juveniles did the same. And the worst part? It's not like Łódź had anything to offer the Scouts, who took pride in shunning the amenities many would consider essential. \n 'How are your barracks constructed? No really, describe the process and the materials and tools.' \n The scouts were speechless, and the greyshirt was fidgeting and eventually producing words. \n 'I saw your headquarters. What little wood is used, those are Łódź nails that keep it together. Concrete and panels made in factories that are urban creations. Welded steel. And the tools you use to rule the forest? Every axe and pick and knife, made of steel. Do you have your own metalworking? It's not as easy as in Rust with one bloomery forge...'\n 'what the hell is Rust...' - the greenshirt pondered. \n 'You're already dependent on city tools and modern labour to prevent your outdoors survivalism from deteriorating into neolithic LARP. What I'm offering you, is to never have to worry about your dependence on cities ever again. Because maintenence and delivery of any tool you need, whether it's a nail or a hammer, will be a given. So stop worrying about how ideologically pure your procurement is and enter the Dialogue.' \n 'And let the decadents burn our forests and continue destroying the planet?' \n 'Then talk the city folk out of it. Meanwhile we're going to commit to net-zero Łódź within mere years. When Poland's out of the gutter, all your ecologist dreams will come true, except the one where we're all in Stone Age.' \n It worked, after long hours. It worked.

Their Scout instructor, a small and stout man in green uniform, gave the signal. A pinecone flew through the broken window. 3 seconds later, they all breached breached. The Scout was not in his element. It was a miracle he didn't fluked the urban warfare classes at the ZHP barracks, given they were so used to field warfare. Urban warfare was something else. Breaching, multi-story buildings, rubble... So much to watch so much to do. 'Clear!' - he heard the girl yell 'Clear!' - echoed Patryk. 'Are you nonces checking the rooms on your own again?' - The two breachers (was it three?) quickly converged on each other again. They were learning fast, just like how the anxious Scout was. He still had his handbook, 'Understanding Urban Warfare', a rare artifact around these parts, but widely available elsewhere. He'd read it instead of sleeping. If he was still a juvenile, his bunkmates would give him wedgies for reading with flashlight. Instead, they 'borrowed' his book all the time, and made him replicate his notes. The solution was found in Łódź city; he got to know an owner of industrial printing company. If its operations were restored, he'd be able to broker replication of his book, which would be a great boon for ZHP war knowhow, copyrights be damned. \n 'FINISH' - the two breachers yelled, standing by at the finish point; The entry to derelict apartment at the other side. Slowly observing them throughout the training, the scout followed their way. \n 'You barely worked in unison, you cleared the place in 50% more time than average, and where the hell is Kamil? You have much to learn.' \n 'More like YOU have much to learn. Every other moment during lectures or instructions you were staring at that book of yours.' - Patryk remarked. \n 'You're a little lippy for a Monday' - the scout replied and tossed him the book. 'See if you can do any better with it while I look for Kamil' \n Just like his students before him, he checked each room on the floor they were clearing. Normally they'd have to clear the whole apartment, but with these urban primadonnas you'd be hard pressed to squeeze a single floor. He should just drag them to the forest and let Grey Lilies haze them until they behaved. He found Kamil in penultimate room, pilfering through a corpse in military uniform. Stealing, pinching, thieving everything shiny he could see. Also, the skeleton had a joker hat on its skull. The scout just waited till the inevitable happened. Kamil screamed and jumped back. The chest of the skeleton opened up, the whopee cushion in his ribs discharging air with a kitschy sound. The skeleton's pistol discharged a small stick with a colorful flag saying 'BANG!' \n 'Never loot anything you see without thorough examination, actually, not ever! Mark it down if it looks valuable, but ANYTHING can be booby-trapped. And never be alone. If you're alone, rally to a buddy.' - The scout spoke with the voice of a Grey Lily he once feared the most, who taught him how to survive in the forest. No longer afraid of the concrete jungle, he felt that with that book, the city could be as forest to him. Kamil still trembled. Just like the scout before him. He'll go far. Eventually."

But, he was surprised when it turned out that despite that eerie masking, he sat across the table with someone who understood how business was done. “Nice to meet you,” - it said warmly before it sat down. The file said its name was Ebrantil, Dr. Ebrantil.\n“So you want us to surrender our sovereignty to you in exchange for… being listened to? Sorry, but that sounds a bit, at best, like offering us something you already have.” - he began.\nHołownia got into the rhythm quickly. The custom of most warlords was to spend 10 minutes on chitchat or worse before the business was discussed. - “Yet, at the end of the day, this is a consortium you represent. A company is meant to operate not as a sovereign but as a business within a state. A state that I provide. An army I provide, which, combined with yours, will look out for you better than anything. A market that you as a company can sell to and truly find yourself in.”\n“Yes, The Consortium boasts many different… operations, which’s products, even byproducts, can be used to fuel commerce in Łódź. We fit each other’s needs perfectly: We need a bigger couch to move products and services to, and you need commerce to revitalize the city. And how is the security of Łódź? Its police? Its willingness to cooperate with representatives of other territories?\n“That depends, we have patrols, and militias typically man the city guard… why do you ask?”\n“Rutkowski’s patrol, sir Mayor. You’d be wise to use them as a police force to bolster their efforts.”\n“I certainly will… assuming our contributions to this Dialogue of yours are properly acknowledged and rewarded.”\n“You’re not getting a tax exception; we need all the funds we can get.”\nWhat I’m asking, you political slug is are you going to fuck me over - Ebrantil’s thoughts were a furious thunder behind his polite demeanor, and all within the noosphere knew his true nature that day. Hołownia wasn’t in the noosphere. Is Noosphere even a thing?\nI understand perfectly, you human-trafficking shit - Hołownia heard the rumors. In the land ruled by lunatics, he had no qualms about going by his suspicions, even if he could do nothing without proof.\n“The only way I would consider investigation on behalf of someone is if that someone was a part of the Dialogue. From a risk management standpoint, all that’s left is to remember the Dialogue is a two-way street.

And it's all thanks to the power of Dialogue and the faith of our great Szymon Hołownia.\n\nTotal Dialogue has arrived.\n\nDuring one of the conversations with the saleswoman in the store, Hołownia asked about her life. She indicated that from now on for all circumstances bouquets of flowers can be bought for grosze, tombstones are cheaper, after all, energy is also cheaper, her son signed upfor scouting and for some time hooligans stopped harassing people on the estate and sometimes they only come to talk about Yahweh.\nHołownia felt warmth in his heart. "That's it, ma'am," he said. "That's the power of DIALOGUE. This is the chancefor Poland of 2050!'' A tear of joy welled up in his eye, he wiped it away, thanked for the purchases, and left.\nEntering the office, he can now see the six flags of the six warlords he has united. And all these people live together in peace and happiness."

Are all the warlords we assembled into an alliance going to just ready up for an all-out civil war as soon as Hołownia suffers as little as a cough? And if his sons or daughters marry, will they just mass murder him and each other at the wedding? It seems a more viable outcome than this, is Hołownia sacrificing the entire city to turn into an omniscient worm! I don't know. It feels like someone's been using a microwave to send digital messages to the past, allowing him to reach a world line of chaos, where anything is possible. One where the Dialogue is anything but a pipe dream. One where the Scouts are all over the carbon-fibre sleeping bags and the Brotherhood is exploring carbon-capture techniques. The Witcher LARPers are playing football with the judeo-hooligans and the Rutkowski patrol serves and protects for once. TVŁ has actually reinstated Judge Jud... I mean, Anna Maria Wesołowska show. I guess that's what keeps us together, i loved that show as a child. Turns out, there's never a shortage of immature, dumb plaintiffs and defendants. Some things truly never change."

It turned out that both military and civil institutions of Łódź were no strangers to both reenactors of the feudal system, as well as shady secret agents that inhabited Southern Greater Poland, allowing the conquest and the incorporation of these lands to proceed relatively smoothly. However, most observers are worried that the sudden influx of reactionaries would reignite the fire of Sapkowski's cause, up to this point successfully suppressed and marginalized.

 ##Characters##
POLITICS_SZYMON_HOLOWNIA_DESC:0 "For decades division has paralyzed Polish society. Where an outside eye would once see a monolithic national identity, cracks grew with increased animosity, eventually shattering the country into hundreds of pieces. And while the political, ethnic, and religious lines dividing the nation have been replaced by impromptu borders, with disputes now settled on the field of battle, reasonable debate supplanted by a farcical contest of strength, the indomitable flame of dialogue still burns proudly right in the center of the vortex of instability engulfing the country. From his base of operations in Łódź’s historic Śródmieście, merely a short walk away from the Nuclear Exclusion Zone of Bałuty, Szymon Hołownia guards the fragile peace in Łódzkie Voivodeship along with his clique of fellow idealists, desperately mediating between the region’s various warlords, a sole dam preventing §Rall-out war§! from spilling out over the state. \n\nAnd while his task may seem Sisyphean to nearly everyone who’s witnessed the reality of this brotherly war, Hołownia remains undeterred in the face of continuous diplomatic disappointments, ones he never had to live through in the first place. He could have simply continued his media career and led a comfortable life of wealth as a beloved public figure. Even following his venture into politics, the option to flee the country was still open. Still, against the better judgment of his companions, Hołownia chose to stay, putting both his life and legacy on the line in pursuit of his dream of §Ga shining republic, built on a foundation of compromise and dialogue, free from radicalism and above all divisions.§! \n\nAs much as his surrounding warlords would wish to simply sweep Hołownia aside, the sheer population and industrial capability of the Free City forces them to pay the politician’s words some heed. And so, begrudgingly, they come to the negotiating table each time he calls, half-heartedly listening to his speeches about the need for unity, immediately returning home to oversee their statelets’ progressive armament. The drums of §Rwar§! beat ever louder as the Second Horseman watches over Łódzkie in wait. Time is running out for Szymon Hołownia, and unless he’s content with his mediations serving as merely a stopgap for §Rtotal conflict§!, he must find a way to bring the region’s disparate factions together under one banner in §Ga grand final triumph of dialogue.§!"

#AIn his eyes the collective memory of Bałuty Tragedy could serve as a backbone for a sense unity unseen in Poland since 1989, if the local factions will be eager to see the things that they have in common.\nDetermined, well-mannered and reasonable, many believe Szymon Hołownia will be the one to successfully bring balance to the voivodeship.

WML_dialogue_SAP1_desc:0 "\nIt's hard to exactly make out what Sapkowski's talking about when every word he's using refers to something present in the Witcher's universe. In order to make communication easier (or rather to make it actually possible), Hołownia and our government staff ought to dive into the deepest recessess of The Witcher books to study what all these esotheric terms used by the Glynblei- ...the Gwynbleyt- ...the Gwynblade- ...the Duke of Skierniewice actually refer to."

WML_dialogue_BBW1_desc:0 "\nThough Bełchatów holds our energy-hungry infrastructure on an extremely tight leash, they fail to notice their own true potential, getting blinded by pride instead and buying every cheap comments praising their energetic outputs. As such, we can easily gain favors with them just by purchasing more and more energy surplusses - in fact, they don't even seem to notice that this way, we're nullifying all of their blackmail potential."
WML_dialogue_ZHP1:0 "§6£ZHP_Flag   Organize a Summer Camp with the Scouts§!"
WML_dialogue_ZHP1_desc:0 "\nDespite their highly militarized and survivalist nature, most ZHP's members who actually ARE scouts are underaged and are kept away from military duties. Instead, they learn how to rely on themselves, how to be self-sufficient and how to operate in deep woods. They're proud of their ways, and they'll gladly share their knowledge with others in the hopes of bringing them to their side - in fact, there have been propositions of organizing summer camps where kids from Łódź and areas around it could camp with their colleagues in the ZHP learn from them, and both our city's and ZHP's official circles say they'd be down to organizing them."
WML_dialogue_KRS1:0 "§6£KRS_Flag   Expand Medical Infrastructure in Łódź§!"
WML_dialogue_KRS1_desc:0 "\nDespite knowing well what the Łódź Paramedics (and their partners at H.Skrzydlewska) are *actually* up to, we still allow them to freely operate in the voivodeship since there's no one else to provide healthcare to the overall population and the only other option than letting people get their body parts sold off on the black market is letting them die from natural causes and injuries inflicted by wild animals. Due to these circumstances, restoring and restaffing hospitals in the region became not only a financial challenge for the Łódź cliques, but also a massive ethical and political ordeal whether one should help their people at the cost of giving the Triumvirate more power in the area. That... might not be that bad of a thing, actually, since thanks to this we can gain lots of favors with the Consortium by expanding medical infrastructure in the voivodeship."
WML_dialogue_ZYD1:0 "§6£ZYD_Flag   Fund a new Stadium for RTS Widzew§!"
WML_dialogue_ZYD1_desc:0 "\nYou can casually play football on any flat patches of grass, mowned or unmowned. For professional matches, however, you're gonna need a proper stadium. And to build a stadium you're gonna need money and a qualified workforce, of which the Widzew hooligans constitute neither. The communist leadership of Widzew's clique fails to put their boys to proper work, so we could do them a favor by helping them out and funding the construction of new stadiums for their brutes to duke it out at."

WML_dialogue_SAP2:0 "§9£SAP_Flag   Institute some LARP Elements§!" 
WML_dialogue_SAP2_desc:0 "\nAs the Duchy of Ellander was founded, Sapkowski started writing new texts and creating new lore to expand the Witcher universe beyond the scopes of his books and to adapt it to the real world. It would be useful to officially recognize some minor elements of his LARP or naming conventions to show that we respect (or at least that we're interested) in his Disneyland-esque façade of the world. Warlords opposed to Skierniewice might get angry that we officially sanction parts of his insanity and may consider this as a step too far in his direction, however."
WML_dialogue_BBW2:0 "§9£BBW_Flag   Invite the Brotherhood's Industrialists§!"
WML_dialogue_BBW2_desc:0 "\nThe Brotherhood, as a major regional power with ambitions to conquer and reindustrialize all of Poland, was built thanks to an experienced factory workforce and a well educated industrial elite, which now seeks to expand their model of production across the whole country. Both our factories and our diplomatic relations with the Brotherhood will gain a lot from inviting some of their industrialists to our city and letting them dabble with some things. Others in the voivodeship will probably not like that, though."
WML_dialogue_ZHP2:0 "§9£ZHP_Flag   Meet with Duda§!"
WML_dialogue_ZHP2_desc:0 "\nHołownia might have his differences with Duda... but nowadays, it's very refreshing to talk with an *actual politician*. Besides, him being an ex-president of Poland gives room for much more informative and interesting discussions than with your typical warlords, and with the right words and questions we could increase his opinion about us, thus influencing the Scouts' opinion about us and making them more willing to talk and cooperate with us. Others might perceive this as getting a little bit too close with them, however."
WML_dialogue_KRS2:0 "§9£KRS_Flag   Hire Rutkowski's men for a Case§!"
WML_dialogue_KRS2_desc:0 "\nRutkowski tries his hardest to make himself and his men appear as badasses. Most people perceive this as silly and extremely comedic - we perceive this as a golden opportunity to satisfy his ego and bring him - thus bringing his partners - closer to us. \n\nCrime in post-Fall Poland is rampant, and given the often survivalist conditions in which many criminals and marauders find themselves - they're also very often armed to the teeth, on par with most Polish cliques' militaries. We could hire Rutkowski's men to deal with some highly dangerous, resource-draining case that our policing forces fail to take care of. Some might perceive this as giving the Triumvirate free influence in the city, however."
WML_dialogue_ZYD2:0 "§9£ZYD_Flag   Fund the Development of Kibbutzes§!"
WML_dialogue_ZYD2_desc:0 "\nUrban's team of economists and infrastructure planners - in their strive to create socialist, religious communities and to up the food security in their clique - try their hardest to encourage their hooligans to create and settle in kibbutzes, but their lack of any knowledge of agriculture, craftsmanship and basically anything else that isn't considered assault and battery makes most attempts at founding such settlements come apart at the seams. That being said, there HAVE been some villages that managed to be successfully transformed into functioning kibbutzes, but they now bear the burden of being the main backbone behind the reconstruction efforts of Hools' part of Łódzkie, leaving them very susceptible to any natural and man-caused factors that might disrupt their production. Therefore, the Judeo-communist heads of Widzew would very much appreciate if we were to financially support the development of those few kibbutzes that managed to stay afloat so far. Those opposed to Jewish and/or communist rule will oppose this, however - we are, after all, funding the formation of Jewish settlements in the voivodeship by doing this."

WML_dialogue_SAP3:0 "§t£SAP_Flag   Create a Łódź Branch of the White Rose§!"
WML_dialogue_SAP3_desc:0 "\nThe relations between our city and the realm of Ellander are closer than ever. We could bring them *even closer*, however. \nBy inviting the Order of the White Rose to establish a new branch section in one of our districts, we will slowly advance the process of binding the security forces and militaries of both of our states together, setting us on a path of dismantling any diplomatic barriers remaining between us. Cliques opposed to any Ellander power grabs will heavily boycott such move, however, decrying it as a breach of our territoriality and as selling ourselves out to Sapkowski."
WML_dialogue_BBW3:0 "§t£BBW_Flag   Expand the City's Coal Reserves§!"
WML_dialogue_BBW3_desc:0 "\nA wise man once said: 'If you go to Bełchatów and scream 'I WANT SOME COAL', scary creatures called 'Brotherhood members' will appear and suck your dick.' There's a good reason why he's referred to as a WISE man - whenever we buy excess coal reserves from Bełchatów, we immedeatly get bombarded with invitations to banquets and official tours of Brotherhood's top-scoring factories. \n\nExpanding our city's coal reserves will not only increase the comfort of our population, but also (in fact - first and foremost) tighten our relations with the Brotherhood and increase their opinion about us. It will, however, also be seen by our neighbours as moving closer towards Bełchatów's clique - far too close for their comfort, in fact."
WML_dialogue_ZHP3:0 "§t£ZHP_Flag   Introduce Forest Preservation Laws§!"
WML_dialogue_ZHP3_desc:0 "\nThe Scouts' affinity for forests doesn't exactly come from ecological reasons, as most of those serving in their ranks are conservatives with a rather dismissive approach to climate change. Rather, they thrive in forests militarily and are proud of hiding and living in deep woods - their role models and heroes did the same things back in the '40s and '50s when they fought against the Nazis and the communist rule in Poland - therefore, they perceive the removal of forests to be disrespectful towards Poland's heroes' stories of fighting for their homeland, and they'd be very glad if we were to introduce new forest preservation laws in the voivodeship. Just prepare to get spammed with death threats from the Brotherhood."
WML_dialogue_KRS3:0 "§t£KRS_Flag   Let Krośniewice Profit off of their Rivals§!"
WML_dialogue_KRS3_desc:0 "\nSkrzydlewski and his clique are always eager to handle the burials in the voivodeship. However - because of politics - only bodies from our city and the lands of Żydzew and the Brotherhood actually reach their hands. We could do the Krośniewice trio a great favor if we were to arrange the transport of bodies from across the whole voivodeship to them and a mass ad campaign for H.Skrzydlewska across the lands hostile to the Consortium. Of course, giving Krośniewice handouts of such caliber is gonna greatly piss off the Scouts and Sapkowski. Especially if the main victims of this operation are going to be burial services located on their lands and the wallets of their cliques' populations."
WML_dialogue_ZYD3:0 "§t£ZYD_Flag   Rebuild a local Synagogue§!"
WML_dialogue_ZYD3_desc:0 "\nThough the ŁKS failed to break the combined defense of Łódź's Jews and Widzew ultras, many religious and cultural wonders raised by the Jews got vandalized, pillaged or even completely destroyed during fighting, and the hooligans who only recently converted to Judaism lack the artisanal skills and the craftsmanship of original Łodzian Jews. Because of this, despite the increasing numbers of Jews living in the area, there's less and less people that could help rebuild what was lost during the Defense of Widzew. \n\nEven a secular power needs to take care of its cultural legacy (of which - in our case - Jews form a massive part of) - therefore, as a show of good faith to our Jewish population, we should rebuild one of the local synagogues that were lost to the war between ŁKS and Widzew. Those opposed to Judaism and Widzew's elites' communist tendencies will boycott such projects, however."

WML_dialogue_WML2:0 "§HPerform a Speech about Unity§!"
WML_dialogue_WML2_desc:0 "We might have our differences... big, big differences.... but ultimately, we share a goal, and the constant hostilities between ourselves only make this goal harder to reach - there's no other way to rebuild this god-forsaken country than to swallow our pride, abandon our selfish ambitions and finally learn how to work with each other. \n\nIf we fail to unite with each other, the concept of a single Polish country might be forever lost."
WML_dialogue_WML3:0 "§HTour Around the Voivodeship§!"
WML_dialogue_WML3_desc:0 "Shady, greedy and out of touch politicians is what killed Poland. People have radicalized themselves beyond reason after years of having to vote for the lesser evil instead of whom they actually want to vote for. If we are to build a truly *trustworthy* government, we have to stay in touch with our people. \n\nHołownia should tour around the entire voivodeship to check on the people of Łódzkie and learn what matters do they have at hand, what problems are bothering them and what can we do to improve their situation. On his way, he can meet with officials of the cliques surronding Łódź to gain not only the people's support, but also theirs."
