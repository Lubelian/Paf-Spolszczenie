sapek.1.desc:0 "In the year of our Lord 2025 the world did not end. Even though many things indicated it will. Men became wolves to one another, and great calamities have fallen upon them. The Wormwood Star fell from the heavens and poisoned a third of the land and of the waters. \n\nBut it was fun anyway. \n\nAndrzej Sapkowski stood up and adjusted the map on the wall of his „innermost private ducal chamber”, that is, the toilet. The parchment was torn and bleaked from constant redrawing and erasing of borders between warlords, up to a point when the duke simply moved it to a place more appropriate. The lines and labels have changed so many times Sapkowski considered whether not to simply wrap up the worn out Poland and flush it down. It soon will be yet another work of fiction. \n\nTruth be told, that's how everything seemed recently. As if the fate of Poland fell into hands of a whole bunch of terrible writers, spitting out pages and pages of their kitschy, badly-written political and ideological fantasies. Naturally you shouldn’t blame people for retreating into fiction when things go south, but there’s escapism and then there are warlords. It’s not an issue that people die in the name of fiction – they’ve done it a lot – but let it be a good fiction, at least. \n\nThus, the Duke wrangled his fame and contacts, and voila – Ellander was born. Its mother was self-preservation, while lust of power and money was the father paying regular alimony. Not the worst place to be, until someone – in this case synonymous with anyone – comes knocking with a real army. \n\nBut for now – Sapkowski thought while washing hands – let the people enjoy the moment. Let them be glad they’re living in a fantasy or just still living, whatever. The storm has yet to begin."

sapek.2.t:0 "Echoes of Yesterday"
sapek.2.desc:0 "– Oh, Lord, your ways are strange indeed – muttered, praying, Jacek Bartyzel. His whispers echoed through the dome of the church, audible only to God and His Mother, as Bartyzel ordered to make the temple a restricted zone while he was conversing with the Almighty about the precarious situation he found himself in. \n\nMonarchy is, as every Catholic should know, the God-ordained form of government. It is the only barrier reliable enough to defend against moral corruption and communism. That is what Bartyzel believed, although during his years in PRL and the III Republic he witnessed how monarchic ideas faded even further into oblivion and he even began thinking the cause might be lost. But God took notice and sent calamities and Anarchy as a divine punishment reminding of the right way. A problem appeared, however – no legitimate pretender would be willing in their right mind to devote themself to a broken country. Where should the monarch come from, then? Indecisive and isolated, the monarchists made a bid for power, but they quickly found out they’ve bitten off more than they could chew. \n\nSapkowski’s rise to power reminded Bartyzel of the legends told about barbarian kings from the dawn of Christian Europe. True, he’s quite godless, and many of his supporters are outright blasphemous, but have things like that stopped the Word of God for long? Bartyzel put his pride on a shelf and offered his support to the Duke. This proved a deciding factor in stabilizing the realm and keeping its borders safe. \n\nIn time the ways of the Lord will straighten. Meanwhile, Bartyzel hones his supporters into an effective, loyal and zealous paramilitary, ready to uphold the tradition of true monarchism. Conventionally named the Order of the White Rose, it has become a home for all those sympathizing with the right. For now Bartyzel, as the Grandmaster of the Order, still has to tread carefully, but when the time is right, he might be strong enough to present the throne as an offering to a more respectable, worthy and virtuous monarch. \n\n– So help me God –  he concluded, rising from the church floor and heading towards the exit."

They are a disorganized mob, and either we deal with them like one should with brigands, or they’ll act like the ones in our lands. \nSome of the council members whispered angrily. This will anger our subjects, they said. Piekara prepared for a response, but Ziemiański interrupted him. \n– It’s better not to make any enemies just as our reign has solidified. Maribor fights with gold, and that weapon will prove deadly to us, if we engage our forces carelessly. \n\n – When it comes to my opinion – Sapkowski leaned over the map – I am concerned with what happens in Wyzima. They’ve elected a „king” from among their own. This city is lawless, and ripe with crime, debauchery and whoring. We can’t leave our capital in that state. \n– These are the words of wisdom, my liege! – Bartyzel proclaimed, as his supporters clapped and nodded in an overtly enthusiastic manner. – We surely could find an ally in the Brotherhood of Bełcha... I mean Mahakam. I can reach out to them for aid. \n\n – Let us not reveal that we’re the first ones asking for help – Sapkowski replied. – For now, all I wanted is to know your opinion, and with that knowledge I’ll take a bit of time to ponder over – his  face grimaced as if he was mocking someone – our politics. But you, sir Jacek – he nodded to Dukaj – you haven’t voiced your opinion yet. \n– I don’t think there’s any point in seeking conflict now, my liege. It’s going to find us soon enough."

Mutilated guards were finished off with short knives. A band of men armed with submachine guns and grenades broke through into the facility. \n\nThe Director (formally addressed as „master wizard potioner to the Duke”) tried to contact the city constable immediately, but the signal was jammed. The constabulary was put on alert immediately after the explosion was heard, but just a few minutes later the town square was filled with the rattle of machine guns. A few high-speed, pocket-size technicals have broken into the city, aiming at windows and passersby and throwing grenades through broken glass. The constable, fearing this is an attempt on the Duke’s life, sent a large detachment to guard the ducal palace, ordering the rest to block the streets and attempt to surround the technicals. \n\nMeanwhile, the facility burned. The attackers showered disoriented guards with furious fire, spreading sheer terror through the premises. While they fought, another detachment of technicals rode through the western breach, aiming straight for the laboratories and warehouses. Men clad in balaclavas got off them and in a blink of an eye reached the most coveted secrets of Duchy’s wizards. Overwhelming the few remaining guards, they begun lading technicals with testing vials, newly-devised concoctions and strongboxes containing the recipes. \n\nJust as the Director tried to make one more call, one of the raiders broke into his room and stabbed his back, howling stridently in bloody rage. The wizard fell to the floor, seeing as the fiery glow overtook the sky behind the windows. Screams, both frenzied and terrified along with thunderous explosions came from the city."

Those who did, ran out of the town faster than Jaskier when it turned out his seductive elven maiden was actually a crossdresser. The crowd making itself scarce was the worst of it all: Many figured they'd pack up their things. Enough of their carts could clog up the streets, which would pose trouble for city guard out to get the fire under control. Of course, with most fire engines out of commission, the limited guards and the military were understength. Priorities had to be made: Many a brother was seen in burning church, or stables, and had to be saved, him and the horses. But then again, the government castle was imperiled as well, along the most precious mana of all: The political mana, without which the Director could cast none of his edicts.

Unless they remembered to refrigerate it; with them, you never knew, they'd have blown up little more than fertilizer. \n 'Łowicz town hall, where token reception was lost. Our Łowicz admin center was relocated to the local church ruin the whole time. The Inquisitor figured he could interrogate people more conveniently if the governing organ was out of sight. We almost caught a would-be saboteur at Rawa, but our guard swore he was a colored, tattooed man who went through the portal. We had him whipped for drinking on the job, naturally.' \n 'That's it?' - Sapkowski asked with weary voice. \n 'They... blew up our experimental potions. Bulk of our research is in Rawa, but project Selkimore and project Blueberry are... where the devil says goodnight.' Then they went on about human casualties, but Sapkowski's ears checked out already. His thoughts were a tornado that swept the clowns around him away, and he and his plans were in its eye. In full serenity, he complentated his plan to make his monster slayers real. The setback in form of these terror strikes? Minimal. These two were backup projects, entirely replacable.

We are now faced with a difficult decision. We must choose where to build the new seat for the Order of the White Rose, a decision that will have serious political implications.\n\nThe first option is to rebuild the ruins in Łowicz, a location with a rich history and strong cultural ties. However, this choice could be seen as a blatant attempt to reclaim the past and could be met with resistance from those who do not support the Order's ideals. It seems most neutral in terms of influence of Order's control over internal politics of Ellander.\n\nThe second option is to rebuild a palace at Bedlno, a location with fewer historical ties. While this choice may be less controversial, it could also be seen as lacking in the grandeur and gravitas that the order aims to project. Besides, sending them to some god-forsaken village may look for them like an offence, and Bartyzel won't certainly like having to drive his old car through those abandoned roads.\n\nThe third option is to build the seat at Pałacyk Myśliwski in Kaer Nevitz, a location that is relatively neutral and has the added benefit of being close to Sapkowski's own residence. But this actually may be the most dangerous option, as convenient as it might look. Distance from Royal Castle to Order's seat would be few minutes at least. If they were to make a move...and besides - Duke would have to hear Bartyzel' blabbering non-stop. Is it worth it?\n\nAs Sapkowski weighs the pros and cons of each option, he knows that whichever decision he makes will have far-reaching consequences.

This option has the advantage of serving a civilian purpose, as the farm could be used to feed the poor and oppressed people Scoia'tael are so keen to defend. It will certainly calm them down and bring some more stability both to the region and internal factionalism.\nAlternatively, Sapkowski could choose to build the farm in Moskwa, a strategic location that is close to the army and commandos and rangers. This option would give the Scoia'tael a valuable resource to support their military efforts, but it could also lead to increased tensions with the surrounding community, and most importantly - it would antagonize Hołownia. As much as that would make Sapkowski smile, it's not reasonable at this point.\n\nUltimately, the decision is Sapkowski's to make, and he must weigh the pros and cons of each option carefully.

All military personnel are to undergo rigorous training and be prepared for the ultimate sacrifice in order to achieve our destiny of a reborn Temeria.\nHe paused for a moment and saw that no one understood what he was talking about. The dull-faced faces looked from one another to the officer and up into the sky, as if a passing bird were about to utter an answer. The resigned captain sighed, drew air into his lungs and shouted:\n- We're going to fuck up the Consortium! There will be a higher pay! And war!\n\nThe crowd suddenly cheered, the soldiers started throwing their helmets into the air and chanting "God save Temeria!". Sometimes the masses are simple to manipulate. But the officers of the Ellander Army are often as intelligent as they are."

Całe ich istnienie było mniejszym złem. Prowadzeni przez kutasów i patriotów, pilnie wyruszyli na drugą misję w tej kampanii: Dostarczyć żądania Ellandera do Wyzimy. Szymon Hołownia nigdy nie stawał przed śmiertelnymi dylematami, a w tym miał się zawieść. Proste. Podejść do granicy Wyzimy i zażądać rozmowy. \n‘Do władcy temerskiego, pana Wyzimy, pana dialogu, Szymona I, przybywa wysłannik z Ellander, żądając od miasta bezwarunkowej kapitulacji.’ - Niebieskie Pasy spełniły to żądanie. Zespół składający się z dwudziestu czterech osób musiał gdzieś przeczytać, że mówienie rzeczy w chórze czyni je bardziej przerażającymi.\n\n‘I dlaczego, do cholery, powinniśmy się poddać?’ - krzyknął pryszczaty strażnik, jak dziewczyna.\n‘Cała ludność Nowosolnej jest zdana na naszą łaskę. Wpuść nas, a przejmiemy w pokoju. Jeśli nie, mam nadzieję, że spodoba ci się deszcz rozczłonkowanych ciał mieszkańców Nowosolnej!’\n‘Ccco?!’ - krzyknął chłopiec.\n‘Rozumiem; nie jesteś mężczyzną, aby zrozumieć masową rzeź. Ale powiedz Szymonowi, że to niewiele pomoże.\n\nSzymon I nie był Szymonem I; był Szymonem Hołownią, który prawie nie rozumiał tych, którzy twierdzili inaczej. Kiedy więc strażnik powiedział mu, że Nowosolna jest zakładniczką, powiedział to, co powiedziałby każdy rozsądny człowiek.\n’Wariactwo. Tupet tych ludzi... wariujemy z minuty na minutę, my jako ludzie. Pomyśleć, że chciałem... rozmawiać z nimi, równie dobrze można rozmawiać ze szczurami! Zebrać milicję i wypędzić te robale z naszej ziemi!’\nSiła odpowiedzi była tak szybka, że ​​Niebieskie Pasy zostały zmuszone do szybkiego odwrotu, aby nie znaleźć się w niekorzystnej sytuacji. To zmusiło ich do opuszczenia wsi, co pozwoliło milicji nadzorować ewakuację. Misja zakończona. Dopiero gdy kończyli, Niebieskie Pasy uderzyły w wioskę, pozornie znikąd. Teraz to łódzka milicja była nieprzygotowana i szybko poległa, oddając życie, by umożliwić mieszkańcom ucieczkę.\n\nNie zamierzali być jedynymi."

sapek_war.5.desc:0 "The biggest problem with Vizima, according to many leaders of Ellender, was the need for more suitable accommodations for their Duke. The modern city hall was a broken concrete husk, there were many leftover palaces but still, it wasn't enough. So, Sapkowski demanded that the entire complex of Manufaktura will be converted into one giant palace. Manufaktura was relatively unharmed, at first it was an industrial complex, then it became shopping center, and now would become a palace. But, there was still a matter of interior. While already quite opulent, Sapkowski had a few ideas to improve it.\nHe hired a team of architects and interior designers to oversee the conversion of the shopping mall into something genuinely lavish, with gold leaf trim (i mean brass, we’re low on gold), marble floors (i mean limestone, they said modern methods could make it look like marble), and crystal chandeliers (scavenged from jewelry, and even that just barely).\n\nThe mayor's staff was stunned by the sudden change in direction, but they knew better than to question the wishes of their new boss. They dutifully allowed to move in additional ornate furniture fit for a king.\nAs the transformation took shape, the Duke grew more pleased with the results. He spent hours admiring the gleaming surfaces and luxurious details, as opulent as they could be in post-Fall Łódź. He looked forward to showing the new space to visiting dignitaries and officials.\n\nBut as the mayor basked in the glow of his grand new palace, the city's people began to grumble. They felt the mayor's lavish renovation betrayed that legacy and was a giant waste of resources when so many starved and had no proper shelter.\nOh well. Sapkowski was too busy bellowing at his soldiers as Foltest once was. He’d probably convert the modern-day city hall into a shelter to calm the people down. Until then, every visiting lordling had to be awed by the opulence. That’s how you keep upstart lordlings loyal, after all. Sheer opulence."

He couldn't explain it, but he felt something terrible had happened here.\n\nAs he turned a corner, he was startled by the sight of a woman standing in the middle of the road. She was… she looked like his wife, boasting a gentle smile.\nHe rushed to her, his heart racing with excitement and joy. But as he reached out to embrace her, she vanished into thin air.\nSapkowski shook his head to clear the vision from his mind. But no matter how hard he tried, he couldn't shake the feeling that his wife was still with him, watching over him from some unseen plane.\n\nAs he continued his journey through the ruined village, the man couldn't help but wonder what had happened to his wife and all the other people who had once lived here. There were so many villages like this: Broken and ruined, their people lost, perhaps for good. Part of him wanted to burn it all down properly so nothing remained. Burn the past away, and start all over again. Don’t let it hold you back. Or, he’d build upon it. There had to be some purpose to this hamlet, perhaps fertile land, maybe something else.

unification.5.desc:0 "Post-Fall Poland is a home to many weird and outlandish political movements. Few of them, however, match the new masters of Łódź in their oddity. \nAndrzej Sapkowski's clique (or kingdom, as it calls itself) has managed to win the people's hearts with its Witcher-themed aesthetics and united all of Łódź, referring to the voivodeship as Temeria. The kingdom's state structure has been described by local and international observers as a "Disneyland-state", using names and references to the Witcher franchise as a way to push its social liberal agenda. The clique was able to succeed thanks to an alliance with Jacek Bartyzel's Carlists, who took a liking to Sapkowski's "monarchy". Other statelets surrounding Łódź, who so far have thought of Temeria as of an interesting, albeit doomed to fail experiment, now watch it in concern, wondering if this Witcher LARP will be convincing enough for the Carlists, and whether it wasn't a little bit *too* convincing for Sapkowski himself."

Calling it Vizima (after the capital of Temeria), he and his militias started riots on Piotrkowska Street, which quickly turned into a regular battle with police units. Unfortunately, the mob led by one of his devoted friends scattered at the mere sight of the armed policemen. For this disobedience, he had to flee Vizima, although in truth he was banished from it. He settled in the deserted Skierniewice, which he renamed Kaer Nevitz. Others joined him shortly after, but some, like his commander in chief, were out of luck. He was thrown into a dungeon for his failures. And it didn't matter that he had known Andrzej for over twenty years.\n\nThe idea is hard to kill.

SAP_voice_of_reason_desc:0 "I survived. At least for now. It wasn't one of the nicest business meetings of my life, but nowadays I can be thankful to all the gods that I was not decapitated.\n\nAlthough don't count your chickens before they're hatched. I can still hit the noose. Because the Chapter is just talking about the war in the Hall of Debates. And if they find out that I was at fault by some miracle, there will be no mercy.\n\nLords are divided. Some of them openly say that they do not want war. I'm guessing that Sapkowki will make the final decision after a long tour of his consciousness."
SAP_choose_between_evil_desc:0 "Night has fallen in the palace. However, I cannot rest in peace on such a beautiful, moonlit night. Then the ideas for the next songs come with streams of inspiration. But tonight, someone is bustling in the halls. He is talking to himself. Sometimes he argues, sometimes he apologizes, sometimes he starts yelling at imaginary people.\n\nIs it some kind of a coping mechanism? Or are we just doomed?"
SAP_rather_not_choose_desc:0 "So war it is.\n\nMobilization letters were sent to all commandos, monasteries and barracks. A recruiter went to every village trying to enlist the peasants into the poor fucking infantry. Some were chased away with pitchforks. Some of them had more sense in their heads and went there with an infantry company.\n\nAll matters of the weekday recede into the background. The war campaign is now becoming the most important. Stockpiling is also done in a rather possessive manner. I hope they don't order me to go to the front with them?"
SAP_tridam_ultimatum_desc:0 "By the will of our gracious reigning Duke of Ellander, Andrzej I, we are committing one of the rather disgusting provocations. The newly formed Blue Stripes training unit was sent behind enemy lines to capture the civilian population of the border village, in order to use them as a bargaining chip in intimidating the Łódź government.\n\nEither they surrender the city or we kill innocent people. Unfortunately, I'm not sure if it's a bluff, or if we really are able to commit such a crime...\n\nSweet Eternal Fire, they will judge us all in The Hague."
SAP_throne_of_vizima_desc:0 "Sapkowski finally entered Łódź in triumph. Strolling along with the ducal retinue along Piotrkowska Street, he admired the work of his destruction. But his destination was, in fact, Manufaktura. He secretly told me that what used to be a textile factory and then a shopping mall is now to become a great palace complex worthy of the king of Temeria.\n\nAmbitious, but first it will have to be cleaned up properly. I'm afraid to think about what he tells us to do with the town hall. Or other administration buildings. Until the construction is completed, the Temerian throne will be located in the former palace of Izrael Poznański. This, too, will probably have to be renamed."
SAP_great_chasm_desc:0 "The height of human destructiveness. A real abyss. Bałuty has never been a very beautiful neighborhood in Łódź, but at least people have lived there. Now it is a monument in honor of all tyrants who do not care for ordinary citizens' lives.\n\nDuke is strangely fascinated by the devastating landscape. He ordered to send the best learned people from the Chapter there to conduct some "experiments." I hope he hasn't forgotten that there is such a thing as radiation. Or at least let him remember when he makes me go there.\n\nBecause then, not only my ballads will mutate."
SAP_question_of_price_desc:0 "The first scents of autumn can be smelt,\nThe sense of words is gone in a blink.\nNo changes in view – it is what they felt\nTears of diamonds on your lashes sink.\n\nYour home all surrounded by snow,\nGlassy frost covers rivers and lakes,\nThat's the way it must be, please don't show,\nThis yearning and grief on your face.\nWhen the spring comes along with the rain,\nThe sun will warm up us both,\nThat's the way it must be for we burn,\nWith fire eternal like hope..."
SAP_war_of_daggers_desc:0 "The Consortium will get a taste of the Witcher steel! Or so they say. It's going to be hard to win since we come with swords for the shooting. Fortunately, ranged weapons were also issued to the front units.\n\nSkrzydlewski's corporate security guards will not be a problem. Ebrantil's creations? The witchers will finally be able to hunt real monsters, after all, they were trained to do so.\n\nRutkowski's elitistically trained and equipped units will be the biggest problem. But that's not my problem. All I can do is fight with words and with rhythm."
SAP_ghouls_and_alghouls_desc:0 "The Skrzydlewskis' necrobusiness was quite a disturbing practice, which fortunately our rulers notice. It's good to know that these so-called 'wizards' are not necromancers yet. The Order particularly clearly condemns any of their activities, reserving a special right to burials.\n\nOf the two wrong choices, I think I prefer a funeral in the Eternal Fire rite though. Some, however, look greedily at the vast distribution network and the entire economic base that the Skrzydlewska company has managed to accumulate."
SAP_pesky_landsknechts_desc:0 "Grand Commander Rutkowski was one of the last to capitulate. His troops fought very bravely and caused our soldiers a lot of problems. Our Chief Sapkowski also noticed it as well. The rumor is that he wants to make an offer that cannot be refused to Rutkowski and his mercenaries.\n\nIf he fights for us, his sins will be forgiven and the Patrol will be pardoned. Otherwise, they will be tried. And the Order will probably be the judges. Then let him not count on any justice. Any sane person would accept such an offer as long as he would save life. I don't think Rutkowski is supposed to be honorable and loyal to a non-existent warlord.\n\nBut who knows? And who knows if, in the end, the trial will not take place anyway?"
SAP_seize_mutagen_labs_desc:0 "Many of Ebrantil's stocks were used during the war, and even before that, we ourselves were buying some strange decoctions from them. We got to know his horrendous inventions the hard way.\n\nSo here there is full agreement that all their secret laboratories must be seized...\n...but we'll probably want to use them ourselves instead of burning these devilish contraption.\n\nThe ride never ends."
SAP_southern_campaign_desc:0 "Skyrim belongs to the Nords! Fuck, I'm sorry. Wrong franchise.\n\nThe North belongs to Ellander! Now that's better. The seat of the Temerian authorities also returned to the motherland. The only thing left to do is deal with these power usurpers in the south. This is probably not the time for rhetoric about the Nilfgaardian invader ... let's leave it for the Germans.\n\nVelen. Mahakam. Brugge.\nWieluń. Bełchatów Piotrków.\n\nIn whatever order."
SAP_pogrom_at_brugge_desc:0 "So...\n\nThere has been a murder. Not one. Not even a few, in fact. A unit of the Poor Fucking Infantry actually committed a war crime, murdering both people of Semitic origin and football fans who favored a certain Judeophile team.\n\nWhy? Because they weren't poor and fucked up, that's for sure. And they were different. That was probably enough. I do not know what our soldiers had to be watered with in order to begin to perceive them as nonhumans who needed to be exterminated in a pogrom.\n\nBut it happened. The consequences are only ours."
SAP_death_woods_of_velen_desc:0 "The forest spirits came out to feed. And they feed on the souls of the fallen. At least that's how horribly the ZHP units are portrayed by the panicked reports from Velen. They are ideally suited to guerrilla warfare. So it's no wonder that in open combat they scattered to hit us with redoubled force after we had taken their territory.\n\nFortunately, we have similarly conditioned soldiers ourselves. Scoia'tael will be a perfectly worthy opponent for scouts. Hunters' duel. We can always send the Order to do the dirty work too. But they can be too extreme, and more than one forest is likely to burn down. And that is likely to make the squirrels angry."
SAP_mines_of_mahakam_desc:0 "And who are you, the proud scribe said\nThat I must bow so low?\nOnly a lily of a different coat\nThat's all the truth i know\nIn a coat of coal or a coat of grey\nA scribe still has its claws\nThe mines are vast and deep, my lord\nAs vast and deep as your pride\nAnd so he spoke, and so he spoke\nThat scribe of Brotherhood\nBut now the rains weep o'er his mines\nWith no one there to hear\nYes, now the rains weep o'er his mines\nAnd not a soul to hear..."

 ##Characters##
POLITICS_ANDRZEJ_SAPKOWSKI_DESC:0 "In a land torn by disagreements, differences, and ultimately - by civil war - lives an old man, who took it upon himself to make things right. His name is Andrzej Sapkowski, although nowadays most refer to him as the Duke in Skierniewice. Or the Gwynbleidd of Kaer Nevitz. Or something like this. Some of these new, ducal names for things can be quite difficult to pronounce... \n\nSapkowski's little duchy started as an attempt to carve out a safe, neutral zone for himself and young people who wanted to stay away from the chaotic murders happening across the whole country. In order to brighten the days of those who hid in his lands (and to dissuade any potential invaders), he stylised his newfound statelet after the world of his most well known franchise - after all, a country of Witcher cosplayers and fantasy LARPers would surely be left alone by any politician focusing on reclaiming the country, right? Right? As it turns out - no. \n\nEllander's first step into post-Fall anarchy's politics was the annexation of the Duchy of Łowicz - Bartyzel's monarchist clique attempting to put a Carlist king on the throne of Poland, which had to swear fealty to Sapkowski after failing to bring anyone to their cause. This in turn provoked the Consortium, which started meddling in Ellander lands, which birthed the formation of a proper ducal army. A couple more such situations, and just like that - Sapkowski became a proper Duke with his own army, his own state apparatus, his own taxes system and an entire gabinet of advisors and vassals. The only thing that remained the same as when the duchy was founded is the Witcher branding slapped on top of everything state related, which to this day puts smiles on peasants' faces across the voivodeship... \n\n...or at least that's what the cynics say, as it is also possible that the old writer has gone completely mad and his duchy is not a mere masquerade, but a genuine attempt to create a truly Temerian realm. \n\nTruth may never be revealed as the "duke" rarely speaks in public and even when he does, his elusive answers and dry sense of humor make it really hard to figure out what's actually on his mind (other than hatred towards CDPR's games)."

POLITICS_JACEK_BARTYZEL_DESC:0 "Who’s to say that monarchy is dead? Bartyzel would disagree. \n\nA radical conservative, he tried to create his own catholic monarchical state in Łowicz, but failed to become one of the key players in the region due to the lack of popularity of his ideas. The situation got worse for him, when Andrzej Sapkowski arrived in the area. The writer gained wide support thanks to his fame, while the number of Bartyzel's supporters wasn't even high enough to start dwindling in the first place. Realizing his faction won't survive on his own, he swore fealty to Duke Sapkowski, promising his faithful service in exchange for the autonomous rule of the newly formed county of Łowicz. Even though he views the Duchy of Ellander as a farce, he can't deny that Sapkowski's regime is the only monarchical government that gained traction in the lands of post-Fall Łódź Voivodeship, and because of that, he will work with Sapkowski as long as the duke respects his right to autonomous, Catholic-style rule."

POLITICS_WLADYSLAW_BARTYZEL_DESC:0 "After much deliberation, the regency council, presided by his father, has chosen Jacek Władysław as a new King of Poland. While he had his disagreements with his father on certain political matters, he nevertheless offered him his help in governing the county of Łowicz and later he kept public support at astoundingly high levels during his father's rebellion. He may not be as conservative a carlist candidate for the throne, but he's a much safer option, as he's already well versed in warlord politics and can actually speak Polish."

POLITICS_KAROL_BURBON_DESC:0 "Carlos Javier Bernardo Sixto Marie prins de Bourbon de Parme is the current head of the House of Bourbon-Parma, as well a member of the Dutch Royal Family. His bloodline makes him a claimant of the long extinct Duchy of Parma and - according to Carlists - the Kingdom of Spain as well, and while it's unsurprising that he has made no real attempts to obtain neither of those thrones, absolutely noone expected him ending up being invited to rule a wartorn, Central European shithole. \n\nKarol Ksawery Burbon-Parmeński - as those moonrunes-speaking locals call him - has been declared by the Legitimist Regency Council of Poland to be the monarch of their soon-to-be united kingdom. Not accustomed to the brutal reality of post-Fall Poland and unable to communicate with his new subjects, Karol tries his hardest to hide his wishes of abstinence from politics and ruling as a purely symbolic monarch away from the monarchists in charge who see him as the only force able to cleanse Poland of its imperfections and lack of virtue. Unable to pull off a Henryk Walezy, the only option left for him is to clench his teeth, muster up some strenght and give Poland what she wants - a Catholic ruler worth following into battle for their country"

SAP_sanity_desc:0 "\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn a land torn by disagreements, differences, and ultimately - by civil war - lives an old man, who took it upon himself to make things right. \nHe built himself a small duchy, of which he was proclaimed Duke. There, he started building a new, better world for creatures of this world to live in - one of vibrant magic, exotic cultures and fascinating peoples. \n§4And he based if all off a world he already built in the past...§!\n\n\nWelcome to the Duchy of Ellander - a state built entirely on a premise of being a Witcher-themed Disneyland, where the army, institutions, laws and even official talks, bureaucracy and terms used in inter-clique diplomacy are all themed after things from the world of Witcher, both ones already present in the books and ones that required new lore to be written for them to be fitted into the Witcher's setting. \nHere, in bureaus-made-throne rooms, Sapkowski holds public medieval courts over flamboyantly dressed feudal vassals, merchants and advisors, all to the delight of kids and fantasy enthusiasts. While this might make for fun public events, it makes for a poor system of governance - especially since even behind closed doors the Duke orders to be refered to as 'Gwynbleidd' and speaks of 'Vizimian envoys' and 'rebellious elves in the south', all without a hint of irony in his voice. \n§tFor now, the Duke's rulership continues to bring colour to the bleak lives of Poles and his rulership is thought of by most as 'a creative way of bringing constantly feuding people together'. Some, however, are cautious of how far this LARP goes and whether this still even is a LARP at all...§! \n\nTHE GWYNBLEIDD SEEKS GUIDANCE FROM HIS TEXTS ON HOW TO SHAPE HIS REALM. THEIR SETTING IS LOVED BY MANY, BUT IF HE GAZES TOO DEEP INTO THEM, HIS PERCEPTION OF REALITY MIGHT BECOME BLURRED. \nCURRENTLY, HIS GAZE REACHES §4[?sapek_sanity|=4 0] MILES DEEP§!
